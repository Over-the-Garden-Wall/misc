\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, I thank my adviser Sebastian Seung for giving me the opportunity
 to work and study at BCS.
 Sebastian has made everything in the past five years possible.
 I thank Sebastian also for having indirectly having introduced me to my
 wonderful wife Maria, whom I met in Sebastian's neural networks class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bulk of the work of this thesis is far greater than any one person could
 achieve, and in that regard, I thank colleague and serial co-author Jinseop
 Kim.
 Jinseop worked for many years curating the data and supervising the workers
 who made the reconstructions featured here possible.
 I wish Jinseop the best in all his future endeavors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reconstructions were created both by the crowdsourcing platform 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

EyeWire
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and by professional tracers working alongside other lab members.
 I acknowledge the continuous effort of both the Eyewirers and all the professio
nal reconstructors, and especially Rachel Prentki, who demonstrated that
 no resource is more necessary in the reconstruction of neural data than
 human intelligence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I thank all the developers of the software that made the receonstruction
 effort possible.
 Foremost among these are Mark Richardson, Michael Purcaro, and Matt Balkamm,
 who all went far above and beyond the call of your average software engineers,
 squashing many bugs and ultimately producing a very slick product despite
 having a very small team
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I thank all my other academic colleagues in the Seung lab for all the advice
 and comeraderie that was provided over the years.
 Viren Jain and Srinivas Turaga both taught me a great about neural networks
 and about the best pubs in Cambridge.
 My long-time office-mate Daniel Berger was always a source of interesting
 conversations and curious observations.
 Neville Sanjana and Jen Wang likewise were a delight to be around, and
 always reming me of some of the most fun times in the lab.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I separately thank labmates Aleks Zlateski, who is also my former roommate,
 Uygar Sumbul, and Ignacio Arganda-Carreras.
 In the latter couple of years, this trio was the heart of the lab.
 They were always full of interesting stories of late-night escapades with
 two of our other great friends, Ranko Sredojovic and Jovana Knezekic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, I thank my incredible wife Maria, and our children Gambit and Vivian
 for their tireless support.
 No academic accomplishment can match the joy my family brings me.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compared to cognitive functions such as language, the visual detection of
 motion may seem trivial, yet the underlying neural mechanisms have remained
 elusive for half a century

.
 Some retinal outputs (ganglion cells) respond selectively to visual stimuli
 moving in particular directions, while retinal inputs (photoreceptors)
 lack direction selectivity (DS).
 How does DS emerge from the microcircuitry connecting inputs to outputs?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DS has been observed in the starburst amacrine cell (SAC), and several types
 of directionally selective ganglion cells (DSGCs).
 It has been shown that the upstream source of excitation to these cells,
 which is provided by retinal bipolar cells (BCs) lacks DS 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Yonehara:2013hc"

\end_inset

.
 Thus, the mechanism of DS arises somewhere in the region of the retina
 where these cells interact, the inner plexiform layer (IPL).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Retinal bipolar cells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bipolar cells (BCs) provide the sole pathway from the photoreceptors of
 the retina to the amacrine and ganglion cells of the IPL.
 Since most amacrine cells (ACs) are inhibitory, and ganglion cells (GCs)
 do not synapse presynaptically within the IPL, BCs can be considered the
 primary source of excitatory input to the IPL.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Retinal bipolar cells were first subdivided into classes by the polarity
 of their central receptive field response (OFF or ON) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "werblin1969organization,kaneko1970physiological"

\end_inset

 or by whether their synapses with photoreceptors were

flat
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

invaginating

.
 These classifications were initially thought to be related through observations
 in the cyprinid fish 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "famiglietti1977neuronal"

\end_inset

, but it was soon discovered in amphibians that the relationship was not
 universal [Lasansky 1978].
 Rodent work in the grey squirrel further cast doubt on the validity of
 the synaptic classification, as a class of BC in the squirrel retina was
 found to have both flat and invaginating synapses with cone photoreceptors

Research in the late 1970s began to focus on classification using the depth
 of the stratification of the axonal arbor in the IPL 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "famiglietti1976structural"

\end_inset

.
 It was found that BCs with OFF centers stratify in the outer (proximal
 to the epithelium) region of the IPL, while BCs with ON centers stratify
 in the inner region.
 These outer and inner regions began to be referred to as subliminae a and
 b, respectively

.
 The subdivision of BCs into more refined 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

types
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 demonstrates significant species difference.
 In the rabbit, it was observed through the reconstruction of individual
 neurons in electron micrograph images and through golgi staining that there
 existed at least nine distinct BC morphologies within the subliminae

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 extended this work to the mouse retina, wherein they identified nine cone
 BC types in addition to the rod BC using light microscopy with immunostaining
 to help distinguish cells with different receptor types.
 This classification was further refined by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "wassle2009cone"

\end_inset

 using additional immunocytochemical markers, revealing that Type 3 (BC3)
 as defined by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ghosh:2004ff"

\end_inset

 consisted of two separate types, BC3a and BC3b.
 They also hypothesized that BC5 was in fact two cell types, which was later
 confirmed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Helmstaedter:2013zr"

\end_inset

 through the dense reconstruction of electron micrograph images.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Helmstaedter:2013zr"

\end_inset

 also identified a BC type that co-stratifies with the other BC5s, but has
 a wider lateral span and stratifies more narrowly in IPL depth, and they
 further speculated that there may exist a third BC5 type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The different types have been observed to have differing time lags in visual
 response.
 This is mostly characterized by a sustained verses transient response,
 rather than a latency difference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Baden:2013uq,Borghuis:2013uq"

\end_inset

.
 While existing work has not yet conclusively determined which BC types
 show more sustained activity, evidence suggests that the IPL is subdivided
 not just into on and off regions, but that these sublamina are further
 subdivided into sustained and transient regions at the depths stratified
 by SACs.

Direction selectivity in retinal ganglion cells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among the earliest work in the study of the behavior of cells in the vertibrate
 retina was that of Hartline in his 1938 account.
 There it was discovered that there exists at least three types of retinal
 ganglion cells (GCs) that respond to different stimulus features.
 He identified ON cells that would respond to the onset of a light stimulus,
 OFF cells that would respond to the termination of light stimulation, and
 ON-OFF cells that respond to both the onset and termination of light.
 These observations were followed in the 1950s and early 1960s by several
 researchers, who demonstrated that there were units responding to more
 complicated features, such as convexity, dimming, and color specificity

 were the first to discover directionally selective (DS) GCs.
 They observed a class of GC that responds to both ON and OFF stimuli that
 moves in a specific direction.
 While On-Off DSGCs come in four subtypes, one for a preference in each
 of the four cardinal directions, other DSGCs in the mouse have been identified
 that don't have such diversity.
 The On DSGC can have one of three preferred directions, while Off DSGCs,
 such as the ventral-preferring JAMB-cell, have been found that only ever
 prefer a single direction

\begin_layout Section
The starburst amacrine cell
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 1980s, the starburst amacrine cell (SAC), a neuronal cell type in
 the mammalian retina, was discovered and characterized 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Famiglietti:1983kx"

\end_inset

.
 SAC dendrites receive excitatory input synapses from bipolar cells (BCs),
 which in turn receive input from photoreceptors.
 SAC dendrites also make synapses onto ganglion cells 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Famiglietti:1991fk"

\end_inset

, which send signals from the retina to the brain through the optic nerve.
 Like most other amacrine cells, SACs lack an axon; their output synapses
 are found in the distal zones of their dendrites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two subtypes of SACs, one stratifying in the OFF sublayer of the
 IPL and one in the ON sublayer.
 The latter are sometimes called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

displaced
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 SACs due to their somata appearing in the ganglion cell layer rather than
 the inner nuclear layer.
 The two types are morphologically very similar, although OFF SACs tend
 to be about 
\begin_inset Formula $15\%$
\end_inset

 larger than their ON counterparts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Research on the question of directional selectivity has converged upon SAC.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 observed that SAC dendrites could function as temporal delay lines, as
 time is required for current from input synapses to propagate to output
 synapses (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypothesized-Models-of"

\end_inset

c).
 They modeled SAC dendrites as passive electrical cables, and showed that
 temporal delays could lead to direction selectivity, as had been observed
 more generally by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "rall1964theoretical"

\end_inset

.
 Their passive cable model can be approximated by a Reichardt detector,
 if BC input synapses onto an SAC dendrite are lumped into two groups: (1)
 proximal synapses near the soma, and (2) distal synapses near the dendritic
 tips and the output synapses (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypothesized-Models-of"

\end_inset

c).
 Since proximal synapses are the delayed input and distal synapses the nondelaye
d input, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "borg1992model"

\end_inset

 predicted that outward motion should activate SAC dendrites more than inward
 motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remarkably, their prediction of SAC direction selectivity was confirmed
 ten years later 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Euler:2002oq"

\end_inset

, as well as their prediction of an outward 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

preferred direction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (PD).
 A SAC dendrite is more activated by motion outward from the cell body to
 the tip of the dendrite, than by motion in the opposite direction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Euler:2002oq"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore a SAC dendrite exhibits DS, and outward motion is said to be
 its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

preferred direction.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Note that it is incorrect to assign a single such direction to a SAC, because
 each of the cell's dendrites has its own preferred direction (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SACimg"

\end_inset

a).
 DS persists after blocking inhibitory synaptic transmission 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hausselt:2007nx"

\end_inset

, when the only remaining inputs to SACs are bipolar cells (BCs), which
 are excitatory.
 Since the SAC exhibits DS, while its BC inputs do not 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Yonehara:2013hc"

\end_inset

, we say that DS 
\emph on
emerges
\emph default
 from the BC-SAC circuit.
 More recently, it was shown that BC inputs do not exhibit direction selectivity
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Yonehara:2013hc"

\end_inset

, confirming their assumption that motion detection occurs somewhere between
 BCs and SACs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, an inconsistency with empirical data also emerged.
 According to the model, the soma should depolarize more for inward motion
 than for outward motion, i.e., have a PD opposite that of the distal dendrites
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypothesized-Models-of"

\end_inset

e).
 In fact, the PDs of the soma and distal zone turn out to be the same 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Euler:2002oq"

\end_inset

.
 To resolve this inconsistency, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Hausselt:2007nx"

\end_inset

 argued that active conductances must be added to the passive cable model
 of the SAC dendrite.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inhibitory connections between SACs are also known to exist 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lee:2006qa"

\end_inset

, and can contribute to SAC direction selectivity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Zhou:2008kx"

\end_inset

.
 However, SAC-SAC inhibition does not appear necessary for direction selectivity
, which persists even during pharmacological blockade of inhibitory synaptic
 transmission 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hausselt:2007nx"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore the present work focuses on BC-SAC circuitry.

 first direction selective ganglion cells, they believed that DS arose in
 these cells through lateral inhibition displaced toward the preferred direction.
 If inhibition passes through a temporal delay line, or the inhibitory signal
 is sustained for a longer duration than the excitatory signal, this displacemen
t could yield DS responses (

b).

 further investigated this theory and confirmed the hypothesis.
 They identified a cardioid-shaped inhibitory receptive field around each
 point of excitation on the DSGC, biased in the preferred direction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another model exists that has appeared in models of biological motion detection
 since the 1950s, but has not previously been ascribed to a specific neural
 circuit in the mammalian visual system.
 Motion can be detected by correlating excitatory input signals from two
 locations, if one signal passes through a temporal delay line.
 Stimulation of the delayed input followed by the nondelayed input causes
 signals to arrive synchronously at the output element, and to activate
 it.
 Stimulation in the opposite order gives rise to asynchronous signals at
 the output element, and no activation.
 In honor of the pioneering researcher Werner Reichardt, we will refer to
 the computational motif of

The passive cable model of SAC direction selectivity is based on the assumption
 that the temporal delay in the Reichardt detector is due to propagation
 of signals within the SAC dendrites (

 This thesis explores another possibility: perhaps temporal delay could

 If the connectivity of BC types with SACs varied with distance from the
 SAC soma, the BC-SAC circuit could end up resembling 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 We tested this hypothesis by reconstructing BC-SAC circuitry using e2198,

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Motion is a spatiotemporal phenomenon: an object at one location appears
 somewhere else after a time delay.
 Therefore we wondered whether DS might arise because different locations
 on the SAC dendrite are wired to BC types with different time lags.
 More specifically, we hypothesized that the proximal BCs (wired near the
 SAC soma) lag the distal BCs (wired far from the soma).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 could lead to DS as follows (

\end_inset

c).
 Motion outward from the soma will activate the proximal BCs followed by
 the distal BCs.
 If the stimulus speed is appropriate for the time lag, signals from both
 BC groups will reach the SAC dendrite simultaneously, summing to produce
 a large depolarization.
 For motion inward towards the soma, BC signals will reach the SAC dendrite
 asynchronously, causing only small depolarizations.
 Therefore the dendrite will

 He recognized that only electron micrography offered the resolution necessary

 After a decade of labor, White produced the first connectome through almost

 were created as a means of visualization.

 serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM)

a).
 Gameplay consists of two activities: coloring the image near some location,
 or searching for a new location to color.
 Coloring is done by clicking at any location in the 2D slice, which causes
 the supervoxel containing that location to turn blue.
 Searching is done by translating and orienting the slice within the cube,
 and interacting with a 3D rendering of the colored supervoxels.
\end_layout

When the player first receives a cube, it already comes with a

 Gameplay for a cube terminates when the player clicks

 Because our AI is sufficiently accurate, coloring supervoxels is faster
 than manually coloring voxels, an older approach to 3D reconstruction

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scoring system is designed to reward accurate coloring.
 This is nontrivial because EyeWire does not know the correct coloring.
 Each cube is assigned to multiple players (typically 5 to 10), and high
 scores are earned by players who color supervoxels that other players also
 color.
 In other words, the scoring system rewards agreement between players, which
 tends to be the same as rewarding accuracy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consensus is used not only to incentivize individual players, but also to
 enhance the accuracy of the entire system.
 Any player's coloring is equivalent to a set of supervoxels.
 Given the colorings of multiple players starting from the same seed in
 the same cube, a consensus can be computed by voting on each supervoxel.
 EyeWirer consensus was much more accurate than any individual EyeWirer
 (

\begin_layout Standard
Coloring a neuron is more challenging than it sounds.
 Images are corrupted by noise and other artifacts.
 Neurites take paths that are difficult to predict, and can branch without

 Careless errors result from lapses in attention.
 Extensive practice is required to achieve accuracy.
 The most accurate EyeWirers (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Improvements in accuracy were observed over the course of hundreds of cubes,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reconstructing an entire neuron requires tracing its branches through thousands
 of cubes.
 This process is coordinated by an automatic spawner, which inspects each
 consensus cube for branches that exit the cube.
 Each exit generates a new cube and seed, which are added to a queue.
 EyeWirers are automatically assigned to cubes by an algorithm that attempts
 to balance the number of plays for each cube.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over 100,000 registered EyeWirers have been recruited by news reports, social

 Players span a broad range of ages and educational levels, come from over

 .
 These statistics show that EyeWire indeed widens participation in neuroscience
 research.
 At the same time, the most avid players constitute an elite group with
 disproportionate achievements.
 For example, the top 100 players have contributed about half of all cubes

Reconstruction by workers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lab workers also reconstructed neurons independently of EyeWire, with a
 more sophisticated version of the user interface developed in the lab called
 OMNI.
 Their reconstructions were pooled with those of EyeWirers for the analyses
 reported below.
 Reconstruction error was quantified, and was treated like other kinds of
 experimental error when calculating confidence intervals from our data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Workers were hired based on an interview and a short test of software use
 passed by 3/4 of the applicants.
 They were trained for 40 to 50 hours before generating reconstructions
 used for research.
 Their skills typically improved for months or even years after the initial
 training period, and were superior to those of professional neuroscientists
 without reconstruction experience.
  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with EyeWire, the task of reconstructing an entire neuron was divided
 into subtasks, each of which involved reconstructing the neuron within
 a subvolume starting from a supervoxel 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

seed.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 However, the subvolumes were roughly 100 times larger than EyeWire cubes,
 and only two workers were assigned to each subvolume.
 In the first stage of error correction, disagreements were detected by
 computer, and resolved by one of the two workers, or a third worker.
 The third occasionally detected and corrected errors that were not disagreement
s between the first two.
 Most disagreements were the result of careless errors, and were easily
 resolved.
 More rarely, there were disagreements caused by fundamental ambiguities
 in the image.
 These locations were noted for later examination with more contextual informati
on, as described below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second stage of error correction, 3D reconstructions of entire neurons
 were assembled from multiple subvolumes and inspected by an expert.
 Suspicious branches or terminations, as well as overlaps between reconstruction
s of different neurons were detected.
 The original image was reexamined at these locations to check for errors.
 The process was repeated until no further errors could be detected.
 The F-score (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

b) between the reconstructions before and after the second stage was 0.99
 for SACs and 0.98 for BCs.
 Some errors may still remain, but it is likely that correcting them would
 have similarly little effect.

BC Reconstruction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Off BCs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because only part of the inner nuclear layer (INL) was encompassed in e2198,
 the somata of Off bipolar cells (BCs) were generally outside the dataset.
 Therefore we searched the INL for candidate BC axons traveling between
 the somata, and traced them into the INL.
 Those that arborized in the Off region of the INL were further reconstructed.
 Cells that violated known BC structures were identified as amacrine cells
 and discarded 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Helmstaedter:2013zr"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BC axons were difficult to reconstruct due to poor staining, and their highly
 irregular shapes.
 They could not be accurately reconstructed (either by online volunteers
 or lab experts) within the 
\begin_inset Formula $256^{3}$
\end_inset

 cubes of EyeWire, which were too small to provide sufficient spatial context.
 Therefore BCs were reconstructed only by lab workers using the large subvolumes
 mentioned above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
On BCs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On BCs were reconstructed mostly during February to December 2014.
 Because e2198 extends only partially into the INL, it was not possible
 to identify BCs based on the existence of a dendritic arbor in the OPL.
 Instead, we identified BC axonal arbors by comparison with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Helmstaedter:2013zr"

\end_inset

, who reconstructed all BCs in a patch of retina that included both IPL
 and OPL.
 BC axon candidates were neurites that pass through the interstices of the
 INL and emerge in the IPL.
 Many candidates could be immediately rejected as amacrine or ganglion cells
 because their arbors were too large, or rejected as glial cells based on
 surface concavity and roughness.
 Little human effort was necessary for these cases, because large parts
 of these cells were automatically reconstructed.
 The remaining candidates were put into the reconstruction pipeline, and
 were rejected as narrow field amacrine cells if their stratification profiles
 deviated markedly from those previously reported by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Helmstaedter:2013zr"

\end_inset

 for BCs.
 Eight were rejected in the middle of reconstruction, and three were rejected
 after full reconstruction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
SAC reconstruction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Off SACs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Off SACs were reconstructed by (1) forward tracing from the soma to dendritic
 tips and (2) backward tracing from varicosities on candidate SAC dendrites
 to the soma.
 In the forward method, a candidate SAC soma was identified as a supervoxel
 with a characteristic pattern of dendritic stubs bearing spiny protrusions.
 By the time reconstruction progressed to approximately half of the average
 SAC radius, an Off SAC could be conclusively recognized by its starburst
 shape and narrow stratification at the appropriate IPL depth.
 More than 90% of candidates turned out to be SACs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the backward method, we located a thin dendrite with varicosities at
 the appropriate IPL depth.
 This was reconstructed back to the soma, and then the rest of the dendrites
 were reconstructed from the soma to the tips.
 The cell could be discarded at any point during this process, if its dendrites
 escaped from the appropriate IPL depth or failed to exhibit the proper
 morphological characteristics.
 Less than 25% of initial candidates ended up confirmed as SACs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In total, 79 Off SACs were reconstructed, 39 by forward tracing and 52 by
 backward tracing.
 After candidates were identified by one of the authors (J.S.K.), reconstructions
 were performed by lab workers (59 cells) or by EyeWirers (29 cells).
 Overlapping numbers (12 for forward/backward, 9 for workers/EyeWirers)
 mean the combination of the two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
On SACs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On SACs were reconstructed mostly during July 2013 to September 2014.
 EyeWirers who helped reconstruct On SACs are listed in the Supplemental
 Information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The forward-tracing method of identification turned out to be less useful
 for On SACs because their dendrites can take rather circuitous paths before
 reaching their final IPL depth and making the distinctive starburst shape.
 Therefore it takes a great deal of reconstruction effort before a candidate
 cell can be accepted or rejected as a SAC.
 It saves human effort if this decision can be made earlier in the reconstructio
n process.
 Two On SACs were reconstructed by lab workers using the forward method.
 The remaining 75 were reconstructed by EyeWirers using the backward method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a parallel study to be reported elsewhere, we exhaustively reconstructed
 all neurons with somata in a (
\begin_inset Formula $200~\mu$

m)
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

 GCL patch of e2198.
 This revealed 6 extra On SACs beyond the 35 in the patch that had already
 been reconstructed for the present study.
 In other words, the reconstructions of the present study had achieved 85%
 coverage of all On SACs in this (
\begin_inset Formula $200~\mu$

 is in the (

\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

 patch, the estimated number of On SACs in e2198 is roughly 110, and our
 overall coverage is roughly 70%.
 Our estimated coverage of Off SACs is slightly lower, as the Off SAC density
 is known to be slightly (less than 10%) larger than the On SAC density

Aligning cells to a common coordinate system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For more precise quantification of structural properties, a new coordinate
 system was defined by applying a nonlinear transformation to reconstructed
 neurons so as to flatten the IPL and make it perpendicular to one of the
 coordinate axes.
 The nonlinear transformation was found by the following steps.
 First a global planar approximation to the Off SAC surface was computed.
 Then the centroid of all the SACs was projected onto this global plane
 to define the origin of the coordinate system.
 The projection was along the coordinate axis of the e2198 volume closest
 in direction to the light axis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For analyses of the Off SAC, in order to correct for curvature, an azimuthal
 equidistant projection of the Off SAC surface onto the global plane was
 made about the origin .
 Then local planar approximations to the SAC surface were computed in the
 neighborhoods of every node in a triangular lattice.
 At each point in a triangle, the SAC surface was approximated by computing
 the mean of the planar approximations (as quaternions with yaw constrained
 to be zero) for the triangle's vertices, weighted by distance of the point
 from the vertices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Off SACs were defined as 32% IPL depth.
 We also reconstructed a few On SACs, and defined them as 62%.
 These choices placed the edge of the INL at 0%.
 Structural properties of all cells were computed based on the locations
 of their surface voxels after transformation into the new coordinates.
 All dimensions are uncorrected for tissue shrinkage, which was previously
 estimated at 14% by comparison of two-photon and serial EM images

 BCs of the same type overlapped enough to violate the mosaic property.
 Corrections were made by an automatic algorithm that greedily swapped cells
 from one cluster to another such that the total overlap between convex
 hulls of cells of a given type was minimized.
 Two swaps were vetoed by an expert (J.S.K) on the basis of morphological
 features.
 In all, six cells were swapped within BC1/2 and 13 within BC3/4.

We define the stratification profile as the density of surface area versus
 depth in the IPL.
 For the purpose of BC classification, we restricted the domain of the stratific
ation profile to the interval between IPL depth 0.4 and 1.
 The domain omitted depths between 0 and 0.4 to exclude the trunks of the
 axonal arbors, which increase variability of the stratification profiles.
 Each stratification profile is normalized like a probability density, so
 that profile area between IPL depths 0.4 and 1 integrates to unity.
 Since IPL depth is dimensionless, the stratification profile is also dimensionl
ess.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 defined stratification profile as the density of reconstructed skeleton.
 This definition is slightly different from ours, but yields similar results
 (data not shown).
 Percentiles are defined for a stratification profile, in the same way as
 for a probability density.
 Namely, the interval from the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

th percentile depth to 0th percentile depth contains 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 percent of the area of the stratification profile.
 As mentioned earlier, 0th percentile depth is defined as IPL depth 0.4.
 The thickness of the stratification profile is defined as the difference
 between 85th and 25th percentile depths.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Helmstaedter:2013zr"

\end_inset

 defined thickness as the difference between 75th and 25th percentile depths,
 which yields similar classifications.
 In addition to stratification, we characterized single cell anatomy by
 a further property, the area of the cell's projection onto the tangential
 (
\begin_inset Formula $xy$

) plane.

\begin_layout Standard
We hierarchically clustered our On BCs as follows.
 The axonal arbors of BC5 and XBC lie between the Off and On SACs.
 Accordingly, a BC5/XBC cluster separates from other types based on 85th
 percentile depth (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:on-bc-class"

\end_inset

a).
 This cluster in turn subdivides by 25th percentile depth into outer (closer
 to the INL) and inner (closer to the GCL) clusters (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:on-bc-class"

\end_inset

b).
 The outer cluster can be divided into BC5t and BC5o; the former is more
 thickly stratified than the latter (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

d).
 The inner cluster divides into XBC and BC5i based on projection area (

 BC7 separates from the others by 85th percentile depth (

 Then BC6, BC8/9, and RBC separate from each other based on projection area

 relatively thin axons of these three types in the interstices of the INL.
 Alternatively, these cell types might be truly underrepresented in our

 The splits are highly convincing near the top of the hierarchy, but less
 convincing near the bottom.
 Therefore we sought further validation from the principle that the arbors
 of a bipolar cell type should 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tile
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the retina with little overlap.
 If the hierarchical clustering yields cell types that tile the retina,
 that would be independent validation of the clustering, which relied only
 on anatomical properties of single cells.
 For all types, few violations of the tiling principle were observed (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Classification-of-On"

\end_inset

e, f, g).
 There are some holes in the tilings, but they are likely the result of
 omissions in cell reconstruction rather than classification errors.
 Violations of tiling can be rectified by swapping cells between types,
 to yield improved classifications.
 The fraction of swapped cells is small.

 The novelty is the subdivision of BC5 into three types called BC5t, BC5i,

 The three types stratify at similar depths (

 subtle differences between their stratification profiles.
 BC5-inner (

We are confident of our three-way division of BC5 based on stratification
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 On the other hand, when BC5 cells are divided into just two clusters, it

We were able to replicate and improve the contact-based classification by
 making use of a large set of ganglion cells that were reconstructed from
 the e2198 dataset in a parallel study to be reported elsewhere.
 From this set of ganglion cells, we identified 16 examples of gc31-56 and
 19 examples of gc36-51 based on their distinctive stratification profiles

Each ganglion cell type is named based on the first and third quartiles
 of its average stratification profile, i.e., gc31-56 refers to a stratification
 profile with first and third quartiles at 0.31 and 0.56 IPL depth, respectively.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

The arbors of each ganglion cell type completely cover the central region
 of e2198 where the bipolar cells are located, because the reconstructed
 ganglion cells include those with cell bodies outside the central region.
 For each BC5 cell, we quantified the fraction of its axonal surface area
 in contact with gc31-56 cells, and the fraction of its axonal area in contact
 with gc36-51 cells.
 Then BC5 indeed splits nicely into two clusters based on the two contact
 fractions (

 Motion is a spatiotemporal phenomenon: an object at one location appears
 somewhere else after a time delay.
 Therefore we wondered whether DS might arise because different locations
 on the SAC dendrite are wired to BC types with different time lags.
 More specifically, we hypothesized that the proximal BCs (wired near the
 SAC soma) lag the distal BCs (wired far from the soma).

 Motion outward from the soma will activate the proximal BCs followed by
 the distal BCs.
 If the stimulus speed is appropriate for the time lag, signals from both
 BC groups will reach the SAC dendrite simultaneously, summing to produce
 a large depolarization.
 For motion inward towards the soma, BC signals will reach the SAC dendrite
 asynchronously, causing only small depolarizations.

 The BCs of each type formed a

 This is generally accepted as an important defining property of a retinal

 When the columns of the contact matrix were sorted by BC type (

 These absolute areas were normalized to convert them into the percentage

Edges of the affinity graph connecting BC with SAC voxels were defined as
 BC-SAC contact edges.
 For each pair, the sum of the edges yielded an estimate of contact area.
 The Euclidean distance separating each BC-SAC pair was computed after projectin
g their centers onto the SAC plane.
 Centers of SAC somata were manually annotated, and centers of BC arbors
 were computed as the centroids of their surface voxels.
 The pairs were binned by distance of the BC from the SAC soma.
 For every pair in a bin, the fraction of SAC surface area devoted to BC-SAC
 contact within the convex hull of the BC was computed as the ratio of BC-SAC
 contact edges to SAC surface edges within the convex hull.
 The latter was estimated by the number of SAC surface voxels multiplied
 by a geometric conversion factor of 1.4 SAC surface edges per surface voxel.
 (This factor was estimated by dividing the total number of SAC surface
 edges by the total number of SAC surface voxels in the volume.) BC-SAC pairs
 with fewer than 10,000 SAC surface voxels inside the hull were excluded
 from the computation to reduce the effect of fluctuations.
 The ratios for BCs of the same type were averaged for each distance bin
 and multiplied by a mosaic overlap factor to yield the values in

 Why this depth and not some other? From 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

a, it is obvious that this depth is appropriate for wiring with BC2 and
 BC3a, as required by our model of DS emergence.
 Following this logic one step further, we wondered whether the observed
 dependence of contact on distance from the SAC soma might be reflected
 in fine aspects of SAC morphology.
 We hypothesized that SAC dendrites are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tilted,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 moving deeper into the IPL with distance from the SAC soma.
 Such a change in depth would be compatible with more overlap with BC2 near
 the soma, and more overlap with BC3a far from the soma, since BC3a is deeper
 in the IPL than BC2 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

a).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hypothesized tilt turns out to exist (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:off-costrat"

\end_inset

a).
 Very close to the SAC soma, the dendrites dive sharply into the IPL from
 the INL.
 Surprisingly, IPL depth continues to increase as distance from the SAC
 soma in the tangential plane ranges from 20 to 80 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m.
 The slight increase is not evident in a single dendrite, but emerges from
 statistical averaging.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Could dendritic tilt be the cause of the observed variation in BC-SAC contact
 with distance (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:off-SAC-contact"

\end_inset

d)? We cannot address causality based on our data, but we can test how well
 the tilt predicts contact variation.
 We computed the stratification profiles of BC types (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:off-costrat"

\end_inset

a), defined as the one-dimensional density of BC surface area along the
 depth of the IPL.
 We also computed the stratification profile of SAC dendrites at various
 distances from the SAC soma (quartiles, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:off-costrat"

\end_inset

a).
 Assuming that BC and SAC arbors are statistically independent of each other,
 we estimated contact from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

co-stratification,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 defined as the integral over IPL depth of the product of BC and SAC stratificat
ion profiles (Methods).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found that actual BC2 contact depends more strongly on distance than
 predicted; the slight change in IPL depth after the initial plunge appears
 too small to account for the large change in actual BC2 contact.
 In other failures of contact prediction, BC3a, BC3b, and BC4 stratify at
 the same IPL depths (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:off-costrat"

\end_inset

a), yet BC3a makes much more contact than BC3b or BC4.
 Also, actual BC3a contact plummets near the tips of SAC dendrites (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:off-SAC-contact"

\end_inset

d), while predicted contact does not change at all because the IPL depth
 of SAC dendrites is constant in this region (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:off-costrat"

\end_inset

b).
 Overall, the total contact from all BC types seems low in this region (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Alternative-contact-OFF"

\end_inset

d), suggesting that BCs avoid making synaptic inputs to the most distal
 SAC dendrites.
 This runs counter to the conventional belief that input synapses are uniformly
 distributed over the entire length of SAC dendrites 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The unreliability of inferring contact from co-stratification is illustrated

 more transiently to step changes in illumination, while BC2 exhibits more
 sustained responses.

The output

 of a SAC dendrite is modeled as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
O(t)=g\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}f_{i}\left(\int dxdt'w_{i}(x,t-t')I(x,t')\right)\right)\label{eq:Cascade}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The dendrite and the visual stimulus 
\begin_inset Formula $I(x,t)$
\end_inset

 are restricted for simplicity to a single spatial dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th BC filters the visual stimulus with 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}(x,t)$
\end_inset

, and the result is passed through the nonlinear function 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The contributions from the BCs are weighted by the 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}<0$
\end_inset

, summed, and passed through a nonlinear function 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}(z)=\left[z+b_{i}\right]^{+}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}>0$
\end_inset

 corresponding to spontaneous output in the absence of visual stimulation.
 Then the BC output nonlinearity can be neglected for visual stimuli with
 sufficiently small amplitude.
 Also suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z)=\left[z-a\right]^{+}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $a>0$
\end_inset

 corresponds to a threshold for SAC response, or some source of spontaneous
 inhibitory input.
 Then Eq.
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Cascade"

\end_inset

) simplifies to 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
O(t)=\left[\int dxdt'\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}w_{i}(x,t-t')I(x,t')+\sum_{i}b_{i}c_{i}-a\right]^{+}\label{eq:LN-model-with-offset}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Now assume that each spatiotemporal filter is separable, 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}(x,t)\approx u_{i}(x)v_{i}(t)$
\end_inset

, and that each temporal filter is either sustained or transient, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{s}(t)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{t}(t)$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i}c_{i}w_{i}(x,t)\approx U_{s}(x)v_{s}(t)+U_{t}(x)v_{t}(t)\label{eq:LN-model}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{s}(x)=\sum_{i\in S}c_{i}u_{i}(x)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{t}(x)=\sum_{i\in T}c_{i}u_{i}(x)$
\end_inset

 are the weighted sums of spatial filters over the sustained and transient
 sets of BCs.
 Finally, Eq.
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) reduces to Eq.
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $a=\sum_{i}b_{i}c_{i}$

\begin_layout Standard
If the visual stimulus is a sinusoidal traveling wave, 
\begin_inset Formula $I(x,t)=\cos(kx-\omega t)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:LN-model"

\end_inset

) yields a sine wave given by the real part of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left[\tilde{u}_{s}(k)\tilde{v}_{s}(\omega)+\tilde{u}_{t}(k)\tilde{v}_{t}(\omega)\right]e^{-i\omega t} & = & \tilde{u}_{s}(k)\tilde{v}_{s}(\omega)\left[1-i\omega\tau e^{ik\Delta x}\right]e^{-i\omega t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{u}_{s}(k)=\int dx\,e^{ikx}u_{s}(x)$
\end_inset

 and other Fourier transforms are defined similarly.
 The amplitude of the sine wave defines the peak and time-averaged response
 of Eq.
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
A(k,\omega) & = & \left|\tilde{u}_{s}(k)\right|\left|\tilde{v}_{s}(\omega)\right|\left|1-i\omega\tau e^{ik\Delta x}\right|\\

\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The term linear in 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is the DS component of the response.
 Assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x>0$
\end_inset

 without loss of generality, the preferred direction (PD) is rightward for
 spatial frequencies satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|k\Delta x\right|<\pi$
\end_inset

.
 Outside this range, spatial aliasing can cause the PD to reverse.
 The direction selectivity index (DSI) is

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
DSI=\frac{PD-ND}{PD}=1-\sqrt{\frac{1-2\omega\tau\left|\sin k\Delta x\right|+\left(\omega\tau\right)^{2}}{1+2\omega\tau\left|\sin k\Delta x\right|+\left(\omega\tau\right)^{2}}}\label{eq:DSI}

\begin_inset space \space{}

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 This is a periodic function of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, because the DSI is a ratio of responses.
 The responses themselves will typically vanish for large 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

, due to the spatial filtering, but the DSI is independent of the filter
 functions.
 According to the second line, 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq DSI\leq1$

.
 The third line is maximized for any fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $k\Delta x=\pi/2$

 This means that an optimal wavelength for the stimulus is 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=4\Delta x$

 Then
\begin_inset Formula

Discussion

\begin_layout Standard
In our DS model, SAC dendrites are wired to BC types with different time
 lags.
 A previous model did not distinguish between BC types, and instead relied
 on the time lag of signal conduction within the SAC dendrite itself

 Like most other amacrine cells, SACs lack an axon; their output synapses
 are found in the distal zones of their dendrites

key "Famiglietti:1991fk"

\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

a, inset).
 Due to dendritic conduction delay, proximal BC inputs should take longer
 to reach the output synapses than distal BC inputs (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypothesized-Models-of"

\end_inset

d).
 Therefore this time lag is also consistent with the empirical finding of
 an outward preferred direction.
 To summarize the novelty of our hypothesis, we place the time lag before
 BC-SAC synapses, whereas the previous model places it after BC-SAC synapses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The postsynaptic delay model has a major weakness.
 If dendritic conduction were the only source of time lag, the somatic voltage
 would exhibit DS with an inward preferred direction, but this is inconsistent
 with intracellular recordings 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Euler:2002oq"

\end_inset

 (Fig.
 1e).
 In contrast, the presynaptic delay model is compatible with approximating
 an SAC dendrite as isopotential (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Hypothesized-Models-of"

\end_inset

c), so preferred direction is predicted to be independent of the location
 of the voltage measurement, consistent with empirical data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Euler:2002oq"

\end_inset

.
 It may also be possible to make the postsynaptic delay model consistent
 with experiments by adding active dendritic conductances 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hausselt:2007nx"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The presynaptic and postsynaptic delay models are not mutually exclusive.
 If they work together, passive cable theory suggests that presynaptic delay
 dominates, because estimated postsynaptic delay is much shorter than the
 time lag between BC2 and BC3a (Supplementary Equations).
 Can we gauge the relative importance of the delays empirically rather than
 theoretically? One way would be intracellular recording at the SAC soma
 of responses to visual stimulation at various dendritic locations.
 If postsynaptic delay dominates, then response latency will grow with distance
 of the visual stimulus from the soma.
 If presynaptic delay dominates, then distal stimulation will evoke somatic
 responses with shorter latency than proximal stimulation.
 This prediction may seem counterintuitive, but is an obvious outcome of
 our model.

A glimmer of space-time wiring specificity can even be seen in the structure

 IPL depth can be regarded as a time axis.
 Therefore, the slight tilt of the SAC dendrites in the IPL (

 For example, co-stratification predicts strong BC4 connectivity to distal

 This would favor an inward preferred direction, contrary to what is observed,
 because BC2 leads (not lags) BC4 in visual responses

 Probably due to this striking symmetry, DS and its mechanisms are often

 The absolute areas were normalized to estimate the percentage of SAC surface
 area covered by BCs of a given type at a particular distance from the SAC

 The resulting graphs show that BC7 prefers to contact On SAC dendrites

 The same methods were applied here, with only minor changes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We compute each SAC's total contact area with all BCs of a given type divided
 by the SAC's surface area contained in the convex hull of the same BCs.
 This yields an estimate of the fraction of the SAC's surface in contact
 with BCs of the given type.
 This fraction is averaged over SACs to yield the estimates shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

A, with standard error based on the number of SACs that intersect the convex
 hull of the given BC type.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each BC type, a coverage factor is computed by dividing the sum of hull
 areas for cells of the given type by the area of the union of hulls of
 the cells.
 The coverage factor represents the extent to which neighboring BCs of the
 same type overlap one another.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each BC-SAC pair, we compute the contact area divided by the surface
 area of the SAC within the convex hull of the BC.
 Multiplying by the coverage factor for the BC type yields an estimate of
 the fraction of the SAC's surface area contacting the BC type at that distance
 from that SAC's soma.
 This computation is done for all BC-SAC pairs, except that we discard pairs
 for which the BC hull contains fewer than 
\begin_inset Formula $500$
\end_inset

 SAC surface voxels in order to dampen fluctuations.
 We bin the remaining BC-SAC pairs by distance and by BC type.
 For each bin and for each SAC that contributes pairs to that bin, we compute
 the mean over BC-SAC pairs.
 Each data point in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

c represents the mean of the SAC-specific means for that bin, and standard
 error is based on the number of SACs that contribute to that bin.

 To avoid this problem, the results of our analyses are expressed not as
 absolute contact areas but instead as fractions of SAC surface area.
 To demonstrate robustness, we repeated our contact analyses after deleting
 a random subset of BC5t and BC5i cells (

 The estimates of SAC coverage turned out virtually unchanged (

 which are different from the depths of the intermediate and distal dendrites.
 Because of this depth difference, the proximal zone co-stratifies with
 BC7 but only weakly with BC5, which is consistent with our observed preference
 of BC7 for contact with the proximal zone.
 Such reasoning was already used by

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our reconstruction of the On BC-SAC circuit suggests that its wiring diagram
 parallels that of the Off BC-SAC circuit (Fig.
 1C).
 We find that sustained BC types prefer to contact SAC dendrites near the
 SAC soma, and transient BC types prefer an intermediate distance from the
 SAC soma.
 We interpret these contact preferences as reflecting synaptic connectivity
 preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spatial organization of the IPL has previously been interpreted as supportin
g rules of wiring specificity.
 For example, the division of the IPL into On and Off sublayers (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

a) supports On to On and Off to Off rules for wiring of BCs to ganglion
 cells (GCs) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Similarly, the division of the IPL into sustained and transient sublayers
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

b) could support sustained to sustained and transient to transient rules
 of BC-GC wiring 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Awatramani:2000aa"

\end_inset

.
 Here the BC-SAC wiring diagram provides an explanation of why On and Off
 SACs are located at the boundaries between sustained and transient IPL
 sublayers (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:On-Off-shematics"

\end_inset

b).
 Namely, this positioning is appropriate for receiving convergent input
 from both sustained and transient BC types (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

c).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also find three differences between the On and Off circuits.
 First, BC7 and BC5i/t prefer to contact closer to the On SAC soma than
 their analogs BC2 and BC3a contact to the Off SAC soma (compare 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Wiring-specificity-ON"

\end_inset

c with 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:off-SAC-contact"

\end_inset

d).
 Second, the On SAC is contacted strongly by two transient BC types, while
 the Off SAC receives strong contact from a single transient BC type.
 Third, BC contact on distal SAC dendrites is relatively scarcer for the
 On than the Off circuit (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Off-SAC-(red)"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current study comes with several caveats.
 First, while most of the available evidence supports the sustained-transient
 classification of On BC types adopted in this paper 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, the literature contains at least one divergent report about this classificatio
n 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Ichinose:2014aa"

\end_inset

.
 Second, synaptic connectivity cannot be identified with certainty in e2198,
 because of an unconventional staining technique that left intracellular
 organelles invisible.
 Therefore we rely on contact between cells as an indirect indicator of
 connectivity.
 Third, motion computation by SAC dendrites might involve biophysics of
 SAC dendrites 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Gavrikov:2003om,tukker2004direction,Hausselt:2007nx"

, which is not incompatible with our hypothetical mechanism involving space-time
 wiring specificity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We were able to divide BC5 into three types (BC5t, BC5o, and BC5i), based
 on differences in stratification.
 Using patterns of contact with two ganglion cell types, we also replicated
 the prior two-way division by

 However, they were unable to find molecular markers distinguishing BC5

 found that the BC5 cells in the 5-HT3R-EGFP line were all CaBP5-positive.
 BC5t may be CaBP5-negative (Haruhisa Okawa and Rachel Wong, private communicati
on).
 If this is the case, it follows that BC5o and BC5i correspond to the two
 types in the 5-HT3R-EGFP transgenic line.

The catalog of mouse BC types is likely complete.
 Our claim is based on two assumptions: (1) every BC type tiles the retina
 with little overlap, and (2) there are no large BCs, which would be rare
 and therefore could have been missed by our reconstructions and those of

 One anomaly is that BC1 and BC2 tilings exhibit more overlap than those
 of other types (Extended Data Figure 6 of

key "Kim:2014sf"

\end_inset

).
 The overlap is not enough to allow defining a third type that fully tiles
 the retina; a hypothetical third type would be sparse in its coverage.
 Another qualification is that our reconstructions come from a single location
 in a retina, so we cannot exclude the possibility that cell types vary
 across the retina.
