\begin_layout Subsection
Retinal bipolar cells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bipolar cells (BCs) provide the sole pathway from the photoreceptors of
 the retina to the amacrine and ganglion cells of the IPL.
 Since most amacrine cells (ACs) are inhibitory, and ganglion cells (GCs)
 do not synapse presynaptically within the IPL, BCs can be considered the
 primary source of excitatory input to the IPL.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Retinal bipolar cells were first subdivided into classes by the polarity
 of their central receptive field response (OFF or ON) [Werblin-Dowling1969,
 kaneko1970] or by whether their synapses with photoreceptors were 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

flat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

invaginating
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 [Missotten 1965; Dowling & Boycott1966].
 These classifications were initially thought to be related through observations
 in the cyprinid fish [famiglietti 1977], but it was soon discovered in
 amphibians that the relationship was not universal [Lasansky 1978].
 Rodent work in the grey squirrel further cast doubt on the validity of
 the synaptic classification, as a class of BC in the squirrel retina was
 found to have both flat and invaginating synapses with cone photoreceptors
 [West 1978].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Research in the late 1970s began to focus on classification using the depth
 of the stratification of the axonal arbor in the IPL [famiglietti&Kolb
 1976].
 It was found that BCs with OFF centers stratify in the outer (proximal
 to the epithelium) region of the IPL, while BCs with ON centers stratify
 in the inner region.
 These outer and inner regions began to be referred to as subliminae a and
 b, respectively [nelson_etal1978].
 The subdivision of BCs into more refined 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

types
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 demonstrates significant species difference.
 In the rabbit, it was observed through the reconstruction of individual
 neurons in electron micrograph images and through golgi staining that there
 existed at least nine distinct BC morphologies within the subliminae [famigliet
ti1981, mills_massey1992].
 [Ghosh et al, 2004] Extended this work to the mouse retina, wherein they
 identified nine cone BC types in addition to the rod BC using light microscopy
 with immunostaining to help distinguish cells with different receptor types.
 This classification was further refined by [wassle2009] using additional
 immunocytochemical markers, revealing that Type 3 (BC3) as defined by [Ghosh200
4] consisted of two separate types, BC3a and BC3b.
 They also hypothesized that BC5 was in fact two cell types, which was later
 confirmed by [helmstaedter2014] through the dense reconstruction of electron
 micrograph images.
 [helmstaedter2014] also identified a BC type that co-stratifies with the
 other BC5s, but has a wider lateral span and stratifies more narrowly in
 IPL depth, and they further speculated that there may exist a third BC5
 type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A BC type has several characteristics beyond mere anatomy, however, related
 to their functional properties.

\begin_layout Subsection
Early work on direction selectivity in retinal ganglion cells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among the earliest work in the study of the behavior of cells in the vertibrate
 retina was that of Hartline in his 1938 account.
 Here it was discovered that there exists at least three types of retinal
 ganglion cells (GCs) that respond to different stimulus features.
 He identified ON cells that would respond to the onset of a light stimulus,
 OFF cells that would respond to the termination of light stimulation, and
 ON-OFF cells that respond to both the onset and termination of light.
 These observations were followed in the 1950s and early 1960s by several
 researchers, who demonstrated that there were units responding to more
 complicated features, such as convexity, dimming, and color specificity
 [Lettvin1959, Wiesel1960, Wagner&MacNichol1961].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Barlow&Levick1964] were the first to discover directionally selective (DS)
 GCs.
 They observed a class of GC that responds to both ON and OFF stimuli that
 moves in a specific direction.
 They believed that DS arose in these cells through lateral inhibition displaced
 toward the preferred direction.
 If inhibition passes through a temporal delay line, or the inhibitory signal
 is sustained for a longer duration than the excitatory signal, this displacemen
t could yield DS responses.
 [Wyatt&Daw1975] further investigated this theory and identified a cardioid-shap
ed inhibitory receptive field around each point of excitation on the DSGC,
 biased in the preferred direction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another model exists that has appeared in models of biological motion detection
 since the 1950s, but has not previously been ascribed to a specific neural
 circuit in the mammalian visual system.
 Motion can be detected by correlating excitatory input signals from two
 locations, if one signal passes through a temporal delay line.
 Stimulation of the delayed input followed by the nondelayed input causes
 signals to arrive synchronously at the output element, and to activate
 it.
 Stimulation in the opposite order gives rise to asynchronous signals at
 the output element, and no activation.
 In honor of the pioneering researcher Werner Reichardt, we will refer to
 the computational motif of Figure 1a as a

\begin_layout Subsection
The starburst amacrine cells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 1980s, the starburst amacrine cell (SAC), a neuronal cell type in
 the mammalian retina, was discovered and characterized 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Famiglietti:1983kx"

\end_inset

.
 SAC dendrites receive excitatory input synapses from bipolar cells (BCs),
 which in turn receive input from photoreceptors.
 SAC dendrites also make synapses onto ganglion cells 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Famiglietti:1991fk"

\end_inset

, which send signals from the retina to the brain through the optic nerve.
 Like most other amacrine cells, SACs lack an axon; their output synapses
 are found in the distal zones of their dendrites (Figure 1b).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two subtypes of SACs, one stratifying in the OFF sublayer of the
 IPL and one in the ON sublayer.
 The latter are sometimes called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

displaced
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 SACs due to their somata appearing in the ganglion cell layer rather than
 the inner nuclear layer.
 The two types are morphologically very similar, although OFF SACs tend
 to be about 
\begin_inset Formula $15\%$
\end_inset

 larger than their ON counterparts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 observed that SAC dendrites could function as temporal delay lines, as
 time is required for current from input synapses to propagate to output
 synapses (Figure 1c).
 They modeled SAC dendrites as passive electrical cables, and showed that
 temporal delays could lead to direction selectivity, as had been observed
 more generally by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "rall1964theoretical"

\end_inset

.
 Their passive cable model can be approximated by a Reichardt detector,
 if BC input synapses onto an SAC dendrite are lumped into two groups: (1)
 proximal synapses near the soma, and (2) distal synapses near the dendritic
 tips and the output synapses (Figure 1c).
 Since proximal synapses are the delayed input and distal synapses the nondelaye
d input, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "borg1992model"

\end_inset

 predicted that outward motion should activate SAC dendrites more than inward
 motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remarkably, their prediction of SAC direction selectivity was confirmed
 ten years later 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Euler:2002oq"

\end_inset

, as well as their prediction of an outward 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

preferred direction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (PD).
 More recently, it was shown that BC inputs do not exhibit direction selectivity
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Yonehara:2013hc"

\end_inset

, confirming their assumption that motion detection occurs somewhere between
 BCs and SACs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, an inconsistency with empirical data also emerged.
 According to the model, the soma should depolarize more for inward motion
 than for outward motion, i.e., have a PD opposite that of the distal dendrites.
 In fact, the PDs of the soma and distal zone turn out to be the same 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Euler:2002oq"

\end_inset

.
 To resolve this inconsistency, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Hausselt:2007nx"

\end_inset

 argued that active conductances must be added to the passive cable model
 of the SAC dendrite.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The passive cable model of SAC direction selectivity is based on the assumption
 that the temporal delay in the Reichardt detector is due to propagation
 of signals within the SAC dendrites.
 This paper explores another possibility: perhaps temporal delay could arise
 from mechanisms 
\emph on

\emph default
 to SAC dendrites (Figure 1d).
 Mouse BCs have been classified into multiple types 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, which are known to have distinct temporal behaviors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Baden:2013uq,Borghuis:2013uq"

\end_inset

.
 If the connectivity of BC types with SACs varied with distance from the
 SAC soma, the BC-SAC circuit could end up resembling Figure 1d.
 We tested this hypothesis by reconstructing BC-SAC circuitry using e2198,
 a dataset of mouse retinal images from serial block-face scanning electron
 microscopy (SBEM) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inhibitory connections between SACs are also known to exist 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lee:2006qa"

\end_inset

, and can contribute to SAC direction selectivity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Zhou:2008kx"

\end_inset

.
 However, SAC-SAC inhibition does not appear necessary for direction selectivity
, which persists even during pharmacological blockade of inhibitory synaptic
 transmission 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hausselt:2007nx"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore the present work focuses on BC-SAC circuitry.

Objective anatomical identification of BC types in the mouse retina

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prior work by [helmstaedter2014] outlined a method for the anatomical identifica
tion of BC types in the mouse retina that primarily relied on visual inspection
 of the cells' arborization in the IPM and manual categorization.
 We found that many cells in our volume could not be so easily distinguished.

Identify the Mechanism of Direction Selectivity in the Off-SAC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compared to cognitive functions such as language, the visual detection of
 motion may seem trivial, yet the underlying neural mechanisms have remained
 elusive for half a century 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Borst:2011vn,Vaney:2012cr"

\end_inset

.
 Some retinal outputs (ganglion cells) respond selectively to visual stimuli
 moving in particular directions, while retinal inputs (photoreceptors)
 lack direction selectivity (DS).
 How does DS emerge from the microcircuitry connecting inputs to outputs?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Research on this question has converged upon the starburst amacrine cell
 (SAC, Figs.
 1a, b).
 A SAC dendrite is more activated by motion outward from the cell body to
 the tip of the dendrite, than by motion in the opposite direction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Euler:2002oq"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore a SAC dendrite exhibits DS, and outward motion is said to be
 its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

preferred direction.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Note that it is incorrect to assign a single such direction to a SAC, because
 each of the cell's dendrites has its own preferred direction (Fig.
 1a).
 DS persists after blocking inhibitory synaptic transmission 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hausselt:2007nx"

\end_inset

, when the only remaining inputs to SACs are bipolar cells (BCs), which
 are excitatory.
 Since the SAC exhibits DS, while its BC inputs do not 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\begin_layout Standard
Mouse BCs have been classified into multiple types

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 Motion is a spatiotemporal phenomenon: an object at one location appears
 somewhere else after a time delay.
 Therefore we wondered whether DS might arise because different locations
 on the SAC dendrite are wired to BC types with different time lags.
 More specifically, we hypothesized that the proximal BCs (wired near the
 SAC soma) lag the distal BCs (wired far from the soma).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such

 could lead to DS as follows (Fig.
 1c).
 Motion outward from the soma will activate the proximal BCs followed by
 the distal BCs.
 If the stimulus speed is appropriate for the time lag, signals from both
 BC groups will reach the SAC dendrite simultaneously, summing to produce
 a large depolarization.
 For motion inward towards the soma, BC signals will reach the SAC dendrite
 asynchronously, causing only small depolarizations.
 Therefore the dendrite will

Recently we proposed a novel excitatory circuit hypothesis based on specificity
 of wiring between bipolar cells (BCs) and SACs.
 The proposal was based on anatomical evidence that sustained and transient
 BC types are connected to SACs at locations that are near and far from
 the SAC soma, respectively

 dendrites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like many other retinal neurons, the SAC comes in both On and Off types.
 The On SAC resembles a reflection of the Off SAC across a plane through
 the middle of the IPL (Fig.
 1B, D).
 Probably due to this striking symmetry, DS and its mechanisms are often
 assumed to be similar between On and Off SACs.
 This remains merely an assumption as published studies of SACs were typically
 restricted to a single type.
 Physiological studies of DS were carried out for On SACs

Here we find evidence that the On BC-SAC circuit possesses a space-time

 Based on the resulting high-resolution information about the anatomy of
 single cells, we have succeeded in subdividing BC5 into three types that
 we call BC5t, BC5i, and BC5o.
 This finding confirms a speculation of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Helmstaedter:2013zr"

\end_inset

, who were previously able to distinguish just two BC5 types, but predicted
 the existence of more.
 Our definition of a third BC5 type increases the total count of cone BC
 types to 12.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contact analysis is consistent with a wiring diagram in which BC7 prefers
 to synapse closer to the On SAC soma, and BC5 prefers to synapse farther
 from the soma (Fig.
 1C).
 Among the BC5 types, synaptic input from BC5o is likely to be less than
 from BC5t and BC5i.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the available evidence suggests that transient BC types generally
 arborize near the IPL center, and sustained BC types near the IPL edges

 (But see

 for a divergent view.) Combined with the standard division of the IPL into
 On and Off sublamina, this yields four sublayers: On-sustained, On-transient,
 Off-transient, and Off-sustained (Fig.
 1B).
 Based on this IPL organization, it is likely that BC7 is sustained and
 BC5 is transient.
 If this is the case, then On BC-SAC wiring is analogous to Off BC-SAC wiring.
