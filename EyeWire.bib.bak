	Abstract = {The segmentation of large volume images of neuropil acquired by serial
	sectioning electron microscopy is an important step toward the 3D
	reconstruction of neural circuits. The only cue provided by the data
	at hand is boundaries between otherwise indistinguishable objects.
	This indistinguishability, combined with the boundaries becoming
	very thin or faint in places, makes the large body of work on region-based
	segmentation methods inapplicable. On the other hand, boundary-based
	methods that exploit purely local evidence do not reach the extremely
	high accuracy required by the application domain that cannot tolerate
	the global topological errors arising from false local decisions.
	As a consequence, we propose a supervoxel merging method that arrives
	at its decisions in a non-local fashion, by posing and approximately
	solving a joint combinatorial optimization problem over all faces
	between supervoxels. The use of supervoxels allows the extraction
	of expressive geometric features. These are used by the higher-order
	potentials in a graphical model that assimilate knowledge about the
	geometry of neural surfaces by automated training on a gold standard.

@article{Awatramani:2000aa,
	Abstract = {Phasic and tonic light responses provide a fundamental division of visual information that is thought to originate in the inner retina. However, evidence presented here indicates that this duality originates in the outer retina. In response to a steady light stimulus, the temporal responses of On-bipolar cells fell into two groups. In one group, the light response peaked and then rapidly declined (tau approximately 400 msec) close to the resting membrane potential. At light offset, these cells exhibited a transient afterhyperpolarization. In the second group of On-bipolar cells, the light response declined 10-fold more slowly and reached a steady depolarization that was approximately 40% of the peak response. These neurons had a slowly decaying afterhyperpolarization at light offset. A metabotropic glutamate antagonist, (RS)-alpha-cyclopropyl-4-phosphonophenylyglycine (CPPG), blocked light responses in both types of On-bipolar cell. CPPG only slightly depolarized transient On-bipolar cells, whereas sustained On-bipolar cells were significantly depolarized. Inorganic calcium channel blockers disclosed that these distinct On-bipolar responses were inherent to the bipolar cell and not attributable to synaptic feedback. CPPG had distinct effects on sustained and transient ganglion cells, similar to its action on bipolar cells. The antagonist depolarized and blocked the light responses of sustained ganglion cells. In transient ganglion cells, CPPG suppressed the On light response but did not depolarize the cell or block the Off light response. These results suggest that transient and sustained light responses in ganglion cells result from selective bipolar cell input and that these two fundamental visual channels originate at the dendritic terminals of bipolar cells.},

	Abstract = {In the mammalian retina, 10-12 different cone bipolar cell (BC) types
	decompose the photoreceptor signal into parallel channels, providing
	the basis for the functional diversity of retinal ganglion cells
	(RGCs). BCs differing in their temporal properties appear to project
	to different strata of the retina's inner synaptic layer, based on
	somatic recordings of BCs and excitatory synaptic currents measured
	in RGCs. However, postsynaptic currents in RGCs are influenced by
	dendritic morphology and receptor types, and the BC signal can be
	transformed at the axon terminals both through interactions with
	amacrine cells and through the generation of all-or-nothing spikes.
	Therefore, the temporal properties of the BC output have not been
	analyzed systematically across different types of mammalian BCs.
	We recorded calcium signals directly within axon terminals using
	two-photon imaging and show that BCs can be divided into ≥eight
	functional clusters. The temporal properties of the BC output were
	directly reflected in their anatomical organization within the retina's
	inner synaptic layer: faster cells stratified closer to the border

@article{Berry:1998kx,
	Abstract = {The response of a spiking neuron to a stimulus is often characterized
	by its time-varying firing rate, estimated from a histogram of spike
	times. If the cell's firing probability in each small time interval
	depends only on this firing rate, one predicts a highly variable
	response to repeated trials, whereas many neurons show much greater
	fidelity. Furthermore, the neuronal membrane is refractory immediately
	after a spike, so that the firing probability depends not only on
	the stimulus but also on the preceding spike train. To connect these
	observations, we investigated the relationship between the refractory
	period of a neuron and its firing precision. The light response of
	retinal ganglion cells was modeled as probabilistic firing combined
	with a refractory period: the instantaneous firing rate is the product
	of a "free firing rate, " which depends only on the stimulus, and
	a "recovery function," which depends only on the time since the last
	spike. This recovery function vanishes for an absolute refractory
	period and then gradually increases to unity. In simulations, longer
	refractory periods were found to make the response more reproducible,
	eventually matching the precision of measured spike trains. Refractoriness,
	although often thought to limit the performance of neurons, may in
	fact benefit neuronal reliability. The underlying free firing rate
	derived by allowing for the refractory period often exceeded the
	observed firing rate by an order of magnitude and was found to convey
	information about the stimulus over a much wider dynamic range. Thus,
	the free firing rate may be the preferred variable for describing
	the response of a spiking neuron.},

	Abstract = {The distributions of neurons in sensory circuits display ordered spatial patterns arranged to enhance or encode specific regions or features of the external environment. Indeed, visual space is not sampled uniformly across the vertebrate retina. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) density increases and dendritic arbor size decreases toward retinal locations with higher sampling frequency, such as the fovea in primates and area centralis in carnivores [1]. In these locations, higher acuity at the level of individual cells is obtained because the receptive field center of a RGC corresponds approximately to the spatial extent of its dendritic arbor [2, 3]. For most species, structurally and functionally distinct RGC types appear to have similar topographies, collectively scaling their cell densities and arbor sizes toward the same retinal location [4]. Thus, visual space is represented across the retina in parallel by multiple distinct circuits [5]. In contrast, we find a population of mouse RGCs, known as alpha or alpha-like [6], that displays a nasal-to-temporal gradient in cell density, size, and receptive fields, which facilitates enhanced visual sampling in frontal visual fields. The distribution of alpha-like RGCs contrasts with other known mouse RGC types and suggests that, unlike most mammals, RGC topographies in mice are arranged to sample space differentially.},

	Abstract = {In the cerebral cortex, local circuits consist of tens of thousands
	of neurons, each of which makes thousands of synaptic connections.
	Perhaps the biggest impediment to understanding these networks is
	that we have no wiring diagrams of their interconnections. Even if
	we had a partial or complete wiring diagram, however, understanding
	the network would also require information about each neuron's function.
	Here we show that the relationship between structure and function
	can be studied in the cortex with a combination of in vivo physiology
	and network anatomy. We used two-photon calcium imaging to characterize
	a functional property--the preferred stimulus orientation--of a group
	of neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex. Large-scale electron
	microscopy of serial thin sections was then used to trace a portion
	of these neurons' local network. Consistent with a prediction from
	recent physiological experiments, inhibitory interneurons received
	convergent anatomical input from nearby excitatory neurons with a
	broad range of preferred orientations, although weak biases could
	not be rejected.},

	a receptive field composed of nonlinear subunits. This nonlinear
	subunit structure enhances sensitivity to patterns composed of high
	spatial frequencies. The Y-cell's subunits are the presynaptic bipolar
	cells, but the mechanism for the nonlinearity remains incompletely
	understood. We investigated the synaptic basis of the subunit nonlinearity
	by combining whole-cell recording of mouse Y-type ganglion cells
	with two-photon fluorescence imaging of a glutamate sensor (iGluSnFR)
	expressed on their dendrites and throughout the inner plexiform layer.
	A control experiment designed to assess iGluSnFR's dynamic range
	showed that fluorescence responses from Y-cell dendrites increased
	proportionally with simultaneously recorded excitatory current. Spatial
	resolution was sufficient to readily resolve independent release
	at intermingled ON and OFF bipolar terminals. iGluSnFR responses
	at Y-cell dendrites showed strong surround inhibition, reflecting
	receptive field properties of presynaptic release sites. Responses
	to spatial patterns located the origin of the Y-cell nonlinearity
	to the bipolar cell output, after the stage of spatial integration.
	The underlying mechanism differed between OFF and ON pathways: OFF
	synapses showed transient release and strong rectification, whereas
	ON synapses showed relatively sustained release and weak rectification.
	At ON synapses, the combination of fast release onset with slower
	release offset explained the nonlinear response of the postsynaptic
	ganglion cell. Imaging throughout the inner plexiform layer, we found
	transient, rectified release at the central-most levels, with increasingly
	sustained release near the borders. By visualizing glutamate release

	Abstract = {The so-called 'Reichardt detector' can successfully account for many
	properties of fly motion vision. In its simplest form, the signals
	derived from neighboring image locations become multiplied after
	a low-pass filter has delayed one of them. This operation is done
	twice in a mirror-symmetrical form and the resulting output signals
	become finally subtracted. As predicted by this model, fly neurons
	respond to a brief motion pulse with a sudden rise in activity followed
	by an exponential decay. The time constant of this decay has been
	shown to shorten when tested after presentation of an adapting motion
	stimulus. In terms of the detector model this inevitably implies
	that the time constant of the low-pass filter is adapting. Given
	that, one would expect a concomitant shift of the steady-state response
	towards higher velocities, which, however, could not be experimentally
	verified. Here, we show that given a model with an additional temporal
	high-pass filter in the cross-arms of the detector, only the high-pass
	filter determines the time course of the impulse response. Assuming
	consequently that the time constant of the high-pass filter is the
	locus of adaptation resolves the conflicts mentioned above. Moreover,
	such an elaborated model with an adaptive time-constant faithfully
	mimics a particular contrast-dependency of transient response oscillations

Detailed studies at the circuit level revealed that, in both systems, (i) motion information is extracted from primary visual information in parallel ON and OFF pathways; (ii) in each pathway, the process of elementary motion detection involves the correlation of signals with different temporal dynamics; and (iii) primary motion information from both pathways converges at the next synapse, resulting in four groups of ON-OFF neurons, selective for the four cardinal directions. Given that the last common ancestor of insects and mammals lived about 550 million years ago, this general strategy seems to be a robust solution for how to compute the direction of visual motion with neural hardware.},

	Abstract = {Like most mammals, mice feature dichromatic color vision based on short (S) and middle (M) wavelength-sensitive cone types. It is thought that mammals share a retinal circuit that in dichromats compares S- and M-cone output to generate blue/green opponent signals, with bipolar cells (BCs) providing separate chromatic channels. Although S-cone-selective ON-BCs (type 9 in mouse) have been anatomically identified, little is known about their counterparts, the M-cone-selective OFF-BCs. Here, we characterized cone connectivity and light responses of selected mouse BC types using immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology. Our anatomical data indicate that four (types 2, 3a/b, and 4) of the five mouse OFF-BCs indiscriminately contact both cone types, whereas type 1 BCs avoid S-cones. Light responses showed that the chromatic tuning of the BCs strongly depended on their position along the dorsoventral axis because of the coexpression gradient of M- and S-opsin found in mice. In dorsal retina, where coexpression is low, most type 2 cells were green biased, with a fraction of cells (≈ 14%) displaying strongly blue-biased responses, likely reflecting S-cone input. Type 1 cells were also green biased but did not comprise blue-biased "outliers," consistent with type 1 BCs avoiding S-cones. We therefore suggest that type 1 represents the green OFF pathway in mouse. In addition, we confirmed that type 9 BCs display blue-ON responses. In ventral retina, all BC types studied here displayed similar blue-biased responses, suggesting that color vision is hampered in ventral retina. In conclusion, our data support an antagonistically organized blue/green circuit as the common basis for mammalian dichromatic color vision.},

	Abstract = {Retinal specializations such as cone-photoreceptor opsin-expression gradients, as found in several vertebrate species, are intuitively considered detrimental to color vision. In mice, the majority of cones coexpress both "blue" and "green" opsin. The coexpression ratio changes along the dorsoventral axis, resulting in a "green"-dominant dorsal and a "blue"-dominant ventral retina. Here, we asked how these specializations affect chromatic processing, especially with respect to the opsin transitional zone, the band where opsin coexpression shifts from "green" to "blue." Using electrophysiology, modeling, and calcium imaging, we found that "alpha-like" retinal ganglion cells, which previously have not been implicated in chromatic processing, display color-opponent responses when located in the vicinity of the opsin transitional zone. Moreover, direction-selective ganglion cells within this zone respond differentially to color sequences. Our data suggest that the dorsoventral opsin distribution, in combination with conventional spatiotemporal processing, renders mouse ganglion cell responses color-opponent without requiring cone-type selective connectivity.},

	Abstract = {Retinal bipolar cells (BCs) transmit visual signals in parallel channels from the outer to the inner retina, where they provide glutamatergic inputs to specific networks of amacrine and ganglion cells. Intricate network computation at BC axon terminals has been proposed as a mechanism for complex network computation, such as direction selectivity, but direct knowledge of the receptive field property and the synaptic connectivity of the axon terminals of various BC types is required in order to understand the role of axonal computation by BCs. The present study tested the essential assumptions of the presynaptic model of direction selectivity at axon terminals of three functionally distinct BC types that ramify in the direction-selective strata of the mouse retina. Results from two-photon Ca(2+) imaging, optogenetic stimulation, and dual patch-clamp recording demonstrated that 1) CB5 cells do not receive fast GABAergic synaptic feedback from starburst amacrine cells (SACs); 2) light-evoked and spontaneous Ca(2+) responses are well coordinated among various local regions of CB5 axon terminals; 3) CB5 axon terminals are not directionally selective; 4) CB5 cells consist of two novel functional subtypes with distinct receptive field structures; 5) CB7 cells provide direct excitatory synaptic inputs to, but receive no direct GABAergic synaptic feedback from, SACs; and 6) CB7 axon terminals are not directionally selective, either. These findings help to simplify models of direction selectivity by ruling out complex computation at BC terminals. They also show that CB5 comprises two functional subclasses of BCs.},

	morphology and generates specific visual computations through its
	synapses with a subset of excitatory interneurons (bipolar cells),
	other amacrine cells, and output neurons (ganglion cells). Here,
	we review the intrinsic and network properties that underlie the
	function of the most common amacrine cell in the mammalian retina,
	the AII amacrine cell. The AII connects rod and cone photoreceptor
	pathways, forming an essential link in the circuit for rod-mediated
	(scotopic) vision. As such, the AII has become known as the rod-amacrine
	cell. We, however, now understand that AII function extends to cone-mediated
	(photopic) vision, and AII function in scotopic and photopic conditions
	utilizes the same underlying circuit: AIIs are electrically coupled
	to each other and to the terminals of some types of ON cone bipolar
	cells. The direction of signal flow, however, varies with illumination.
	Under photopic conditions, the AII network constitutes a crossover
	inhibition pathway that allows ON signals to inhibit OFF ganglion

Using genetic and optogenetic methods, we identified two types of bipolar interneurons that convey visual input from photoreceptors to a circuit that computes the direction in which objects are moving. We then sought recognition molecules that promote selective connections of these cells with previously characterized components of the circuit. We found that the type II cadherins, cdh8 and cdh9, are each expressed selectively by one of the two bipolar cell types. Using loss- and gain-of-function methods, we showed that they are critical determinants of connectivity in this circuit and that perturbation of their expression leads to distinct defects in visually evoked responses. Our results reveal cellular components of a retinal circuit and demonstrate roles of type II cadherins in synaptic choice and circuit function.},

	Abstract = {Displaced starburst amacrine cells (SACs) are retinal interneurons that exhibit GABA( A ) receptor-mediated and Cl (-) cotransporter-mediated, directionally selective (DS) light responses in the rabbit retina. They depolarize to stimuli that move centrifugally through the receptive field surround and hyperpolarize to stimuli that move centripetally through the surround (Gavrikov et al, PNAS 100(26):16047-16052, 2003, PNAS 103(49):18793-18798, 2006). They also play a key role in the activity of DS ganglion cells (DS GC; Amthor et al, Vis Neurosci 19:495-509 2002; Euler et al, Nature 418:845-852, 2002; Fried et al, Nature 420:411- 414, 2002; Gavrikov et al, PNAS 100(26):16047-16052, 2003, PNAS 103(49):18793-18798, 2006; Lee and Zhou, Neuron 51:787-799 2006; Yoshida et al, Neuron 30:771-780, 2001). In this paper we present a model of strong DS behavior of SACs which relies on the GABA-mediated communication within a tightly interconnected network of these cells and on the glutamate signal that the SACs receive from bipolar cells (a presynaptic cell that receives input from cones). We describe how a moving light stimulus can produce a large, sustained depolarization of the SAC dendritic tips that point in the direction that the stimulus moves (i.e., centrifugal motion), but produce a minimal depolarization of the dendritic tips that point in the opposite direction (i.e., centripetal motion). This DS behavior, which is quantified based on the relative size and duration of the depolarizations evoked by stimulus motion at dendritic tips pointing in opposite directions, is robust to changes of many different parameter values and consistent with experimental data. In addition, the DS behavior is strengthened under the assumptions that the Cl(-) cotransporters Na( + )-K( + )-Cl( -) and K( + )-Cl( -) are located in different regions of the SAC dendritic tree (Gavrikov et al, PNAS 103(49):18793-18798, 2006) and that GABA evokes a long-lasting response (Gavrikov et al, PNAS 100(26):16047-16052, 2003, PNAS 103(49):18793-18798, 2006; Lee and Zhou, Neuron 51:787-799, 2006). A possible mechanism is discussed based on the generation of waves of local glutamate and GABA secretion, and their postsynaptic interplay as the waves travel between cell compartments.},

	Abstract = {The neural architecture of on and off pathways in mammalian retina
	is described, including the development of ideas leading to an understanding
	of the bisublaminar organization of the inner plexiform layer of
	the retina which supports these two pathways. The complexities of
	bipolar cell contributions are contrasted with the relative simplicity
	of ganglion cell organization with regard to bisublaminar architecture,
	and a key role is described for internuncial amacrine cells as specific
	targets for bipolar cells. Two very different kinds of amacrine cell
	are considered and compared, both of which mediate bipolar input
	to ganglion cells. These are the rod (type II) amacrine cell, and
	the more recently discovered "starburst" amacrine cell, which is
	apparently cholinergic in function. As different as the wide-field
	starburst amacrine cells are from the narrow-field rod amacrine cells,
	they share important features. Both are interposed between bipolar
	and ganglion cells, and both have segregated regions of presynaptic
	boutons. They differ, however, in that rod amacrines may perform
	more specific functions related to receptive field center organization,
	while the functional role of starburst amacrines may be unrelated
	to receptive field properties of ganglion cells. The mirror-symmetry
	of type a and type b (off and on) starburst amacrine cells is described
	together with their synaptic circuitry. In contrast to the rod amacrine
	cell the output of starburst amacrines is exclusively to ganglion
	cells. Others have proposed a dual function for acetylcholine (ACh)
	in the retina. A unifying hypothesis is briefly sketched here which
	relates the pharmacology of ACh and the dendritic stratification
	of starburst amacrine cells to the form and function of ganglion
	cells. It is proposed that the amount of generalized synaptic excitation
	received from ACh/starburst amacrine cells by a particular type of
	ganglion cell is largely a function of co-stratification of the ganglion
	cell's dendrites with the distal boutons of starburst amacrine cells.},

	by electron microscopy of individual or overlapping pairs of Golgi-impregnated
	cells. Both type a and type b cells were analyzed, the former with
	normally placed somata and dendritic branching in sublamina a, and
	the latter with somata displaced to the ganglion cell layer and branching
	in sublamina b. Starburst amacrine cells were thin-sectioned horizontally,
	tangential to the retinal surface, and electron micrographs of each
	section in a series were taken en montage. Cell bodies and dendritic
	trees were reconstructed graphically from sets of photographic montages
	representing the serial sections. Synaptic inputs from cone bipolar
	cells and amacrine cells are distributed sparsely and irregularly
	all along the dendritic tree. Sites of termination include the synaptic
	boutons of starburst amacrine cells, which lie at the perimeter of
	the dendritic tree in the "distal dendritic zone." In central retina,
	bipolar cell input is associated with very small dendritic spines
	near the cell body in the "proximal dendritic zone." The proximal
	dendrites of type a and type b cells generally lie in planes or "strata"
	of the inner plexiform layer (IPL), near the margins of the IPL.
	The boutons and varicosities of starburst amacrine cells, distributed
	int he distal dendritic zone, lie in the "starburst substrata," which
	occupy a narrow middle region in each of the two sublaminae, a and
	b, in rabbit retina. As a consequence of differences in stratification,
	proximal and distal dendritic zones are potentially subject to different
	types of input. Type b starburst amacrines do not receive inputs
	from rod bipolar terminals, which lie mainly in the inner marginal
	zone of the IPL (stratum 5), but type a cells receive some input
	from the lobular presynaptic appendages of rod amacrine cells in
	sublamina a, at the border of strata 1 and 2. There is good correspondence
	between boutons or varicosities and synaptic outputs of starburst
	amacrine cells, but not all boutons gave ultrastructural evidence
	of presynaptic junctions. The boutons and varicosities may be both
	pre- and postsynaptic. They are postsynaptic to cone bipolar cell
	and amacrine cell terminals, and presynaptic primarily to ganglion
	cell dendrites. In two pairs of type b starburst amacrine cells with
	overlapping dendritic fields, close apposition of synaptic boutons
	was observed, raising the possibility of synaptic contact between
	them. The density of the Golgi-impregnation and other technical factors
	prevented definite resolution of this question. No unimpregnated
	profiles, obviously amacrine in origin, were found postsynaptic to
	the impregnated starburst boutons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	a method of analysis that is sometimes difficult and time-consuming.
	When each section is cut, mounted and imaged separately, section

	transforming and displaying data enable the analysis of series with
	large numbers of sections and images over a large range of magnifications
	by making efficient use of computer memory. Alignments can correct
	for some types of non-linear deformations, including cracks and folds,
	as often encountered in serial electron microscopy. A large number
	of different structures can be easily traced and placed together
	in a single 3D scene that can be animated or saved. As a flexible

	The mechanisms and circuitry underlying this computation have remained

	deliver inhibition; those pointing in the preferred direction do
	not. Starburst cells project inhibition laterally ahead of a stimulus
	moving in the null direction. In addition, starburst inhibition is
	itself directionally selective: it is stronger for movement in the
	null direction. Excitation in response to null direction movement
	is reduced by an inhibitory signal acting at a site that is presynaptic
	to the directionally selective cell. The interplay of these components
	generates reduced excitation and enhanced inhibition in the null

	Abstract = {The ability of directionally selective (DS) retinal ganglion cells to respond selectively to stimulus motion in one direction is a classic unresolved example of computation in a local neural circuit. Recent evidence indicates that DS responses occur first in the retina in the dendrites of starburst amacrine cells (interneurons presynaptic to the ganglion cells). We report that the directional responses of starburst-cell dendrites and DS ganglion cells are highly sensitive to the polarity of the transmembrane chloride gradient. Reducing the transmembrane chloride gradient by ion substitution or by blocking the K-Cl cotransporter resulted in the starburst cells responding equally to light moving in opposite directions. Conversely, increasing the chloride gradient by blocking the Na-K-Cl cotransporter eliminated responses to light moving in either direction. Moreover, in each case, blocking the chloride cotransporters or reducing the transmembrane chloride gradient eliminated the directional responses of DS ganglion cells in a manner opposite that of the starburst cells. These results indicate that chloride cotransporters play a key role in the generation of direction selectivity and that the directional responses of starburst cells and DS ganglion cells are exquisitely sensitive to the chloride equilibrium potential. The findings further suggest that the directional responses of DS ganglion cells are mediated in part by the directional release of gamma-aminobutyric acid from starburst dendrites and that the asymmetric distribution of the two cotransporters along starburst-cell dendrites mediates direction selectivity. A model of direction selectivity in the retina that incorporates these and other findings is discussed.},

	dendritic Ca(2+) signals when motion is from their somata towards
	their dendritic tips than for motion in the opposite direction. To
	study the mechanisms underlying the computation of direction selectivity
	(DS) in SAC dendrites, electrical responses to expanding and contracting
	circular wave visual stimuli were measured via somatic whole-cell
	recordings and quantified using Fourier analysis. Fundamental and,
	especially, harmonic frequency components were larger for expanding
	stimuli. This DS persists in the presence of GABA and glycine receptor
	antagonists, suggesting that inhibitory network interactions are
	not essential. The presence of harmonics indicates nonlinearity,
	which, as the relationship between harmonic amplitudes and holding
	potential indicates, is likely due to the activation of voltage-gated
	channels. [Ca(2+)] changes in SAC dendrites evoked by voltage steps
	and monitored by two-photon microscopy suggest that the distal dendrite
	is tonically depolarized relative to the soma, due in part to resting
	currents mediated by tonic glutamatergic synaptic input, and that
	high-voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels are active at rest. Supported
	by compartmental modeling, we conclude that dendritic DS in SACs
	can be computed by the dendrites themselves, relying on voltage-gated
	channels and a dendritic voltage gradient, which provides the spatial

	Abstract = {In the visual system, diverse image processing starts with bipolar cells, which are the second-order neurons of the retina. Thirteen subtypes of bipolar cells have been identified, which are thought to encode different features of image signaling and to initiate distinct signal-processing streams. Although morphologically identified, the functional roles of each bipolar cell subtype in visual signal encoding are not fully understood. Here, we investigated how ON cone bipolar cells of the mouse retina encode diverse temporal image signaling. We recorded bipolar cell voltage changes in response to two different input functions: sinusoidal light and step light stimuli. Temporal tuning in ON cone bipolar cells was diverse and occurred in a subtype-dependent manner. Subtypes 5s and 8 exhibited low-pass filtering property in response to a sinusoidal light stimulus, and responded with sustained fashion to step-light stimulation. Conversely, subtypes 5f, 6, 7, and XBC exhibited bandpass filtering property in response to sinusoidal light stimuli, and responded transiently to step-light stimuli. In particular, subtypes 7 and XBC were high-temporal tuning cells. We recorded responses in different ways to further examine the underlying mechanisms of temporal tuning. Current injection evoked low-pass filtering, whereas light responses in voltage-clamp mode produced bandpass filtering in all ON bipolar cells. These findings suggest that cone photoreceptor inputs shape bandpass filtering in bipolar cells, whereas intrinsic properties of bipolar cells shape low-pass filtering. Together, our results demonstrate that ON bipolar cells encode diverse temporal image signaling in a subtype-dependent manner to initiate temporal visual information-processing pathways.},

	The synaptic connections, both chemical and gap junctional, form

	short synaptic pathways directly connecting sensory neurons to end
	organs; recurrent and reciprocal connectivity among sensory neurons;
	modular substructure; and interneurons acting in feedforward loops.
	These features help to explain how the network robustly and rapidly

	to objects moving in particular directions. Individual members of
	a group of ON-OFF direction-selective RGCs (ooDSGCs) detect stimuli
	moving in one of four directions: ventral, dorsal, nasal, or temporal.
	Despite this physiological diversity, little is known about subtype-specific
	differences in structure, molecular identity, and projections. To
	seek such differences, we characterized mouse transgenic lines that
	selectively mark ooDSGCs preferring ventral or nasal motion as well
	as a line that marks both ventral- and dorsal-preferring subsets.
	We then used the lines to identify cell surface molecules, including
	Cadherin 6, CollagenXXVα1, and Matrix metalloprotease 17, that are
	selectively expressed by distinct subsets of ooDSGCs. We also identify
	a neuropeptide, CART (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript),
	that distinguishes all ooDSGCs from other RGCs. Together, this panel
	of endogenous and transgenic markers distinguishes the four ooDSGC
	subsets. Patterns of molecular diversification occur before eye opening
	and are therefore experience independent. They may help to explain
	how the four subsets obtain distinct inputs. We also demonstrate
	differences among subsets in their dendritic patterns within the
	retina and their axonal projections to the brain. Differences in
	projections indicate that information about motion in different directions

	Abstract = {The retina contains complex circuits of neurons that extract salient
	information from visual inputs. Signals from photoreceptors are processed
	by retinal interneurons, integrated by retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)
	and sent to the brain by RGC axons. Distinct types of RGC respond
	to different visual features, such as increases or decreases in light
	intensity (ON and OFF cells, respectively), colour or moving objects.
	Thus, RGCs comprise a set of parallel pathways from the eye to the
	brain. The identification of molecular markers for RGC subsets will
	facilitate attempts to correlate their structure with their function,
	assess their synaptic inputs and targets, and study their diversification.
	Here we show, by means of a transgenic marking method, that junctional
	adhesion molecule B (JAM-B) marks a previously unrecognized class
	of OFF RGCs in mice. These cells have asymmetric dendritic arbors
	aligned in a dorsal-to-ventral direction across the retina. Their
	receptive fields are also asymmetric and respond selectively to stimuli
	moving in a soma-to-dendrite direction; because the lens reverses
	the image of the world on the retina, these cells detect upward motion
	in the visual field. Thus, JAM-B identifies a unique population of
	RGCs in which structure corresponds remarkably to function.},

	Abstract = {Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which transfer information from the
	eye to the brain, are heterogeneous in structure and function, but
	developmental studies have generally treated them as a single group.
	Here, we investigate the development of RGC axonal and dendritic
	arbors using four mouse transgenic lines in which nonoverlapping
	subsets of RGCs are indelibly labeled with a fluorescent protein.
	Each subset has a distinct functional signature, size, and morphology.
	Dendrites of each subset are restricted to specific sublaminae within
	the inner plexiform layer in adulthood, but acquire their restriction
	in different ways: one subset has lamina-restricted dendrites from
	an early postnatal stage, a second remodels an initially diffuse
	pattern, and two others develop stepwise. Axons of each subset arborize
	in discrete laminar zones within the lateral geniculate nucleus or
	superior colliculus, demonstrating previously unrecognized subdivisions
	of retinorecipient layers. As is the case for dendrites, lamina-restricted
	axonal projections of RGC subsets develop in different ways. For
	example, while axons of two RGC subsets arborize in definite zones
	of the superior colliculus from an early postnatal stage, axons of
	another subset initially occupy a deep layer, then translocate to
	a narrow subpial zone. Together, these results show that RGC subsets
	use a variety of strategies to construct lamina-restricted dendritic
	and axonal arbors. Taking account of these subtype-specific features
	will facilitate identification of the molecules and cells that regulate

In search of clues, here we reconstruct Off-type starburst amacrine cells (SACs) and bipolar cells (BCs) in serial electron microscopic images with help from EyeWire, an online community of 'citizen neuroscientists'. On the basis of quantitative analyses of contact area and branch depth in the retina, we find evidence that one BC type prefers to wire with a SAC dendrite near the SAC soma, whereas another BC type prefers to wire far from the soma. The near type is known to lag the far type in time of visual response. A mathematical model shows how such 'space-time wiring specificity' could endow SAC dendrites with receptive fields that are oriented in space-time and therefore respond selectively to stimuli that move in the outward direction from the soma.},

Depolarization in the presence of Ca2+ stimulated a continuous cycle of exocytosis and endocytosis that was approximately balanced at rates up to 3800 vesicles per s. Vesicles became available for exocytosis within 1 min of endocytosis, and about 700,000 releasable vesicles were specifically localized to a region within 2 microm of the plasma membrane. Release of caged Ca2+ using NP-EGTA while simultaneously monitoring cytosolic Ca2+ with Fura-2 indicated that continuous exocytosis was stimulated by sub-micromolar levels of Ca2+. It has been suggested that the ribbon synapse of bipolar cells only supports transient exocytosis, but our results demonstrate that this synapse is specialized for the continuous secretion of neurotransmitter.},

	Abstract = {Patch-clamp recordings revealed that distal processes of starburst
	amacrine cells (SACs) received largely excitatory synaptic input
	from the receptive field center and nearly purely inhibitory inputs
	from the surround during both stationary and moving light stimulations.
	The direct surround inhibition was mediated mainly by reciprocal
	GABA(A) synapses between opposing SACs, which provided leading and
	prolonged inhibition during centripetal stimulus motion. Simultaneous
	Ca(2+) imaging and current-clamp recording during apparent-motion
	stimulation further demonstrated the contributions of both centrifugal
	excitation and GABA(A/C)-receptor-mediated centripetal inhibition
	to the direction-selective Ca(2+) responses in SAC distal processes.
	Thus, by placing GABA release sites in electrotonically semi-isolated
	distal processes and endowing these sites with reciprocal GABA(A)
	synapses, SACs use a radial-symmetric center-surround receptive field
	structure to build a polar-asymmetric circuitry. This circuitry may
	integrate at least three levels of interactions--center excitation,
	surround inhibition, and reciprocal inhibitions that amplify the
	center--surround antagonism-to generate robust direction selectivity

	Abstract = {We surveyed wide-field amacrine cells in the mouse, using a large
	series of retinas from a transgenic strain that expresses the green
	fluorescent protein (GFP) in isolated retinal cells. Wide-field cells
	were present in surprising diversity and number. They formed groups
	that could be defined by arbor depth, arbor size, and soma size.
	By conventional criteria, these populations of cells make up 11 amacrine
	cell "types." Five additional types have been reported by others
	in the mouse. Roughly two-thirds of the wide-field amacrine cells
	are axon-bearing cells, which have separate dendritic and axonal
	arbors. The axonal arbor of a single cell sometimes covers the majority
	of the retinal surface. The axon-bearing cells appear to be centrifugally
	conducting neurons similar to those studied electrophysiologically
	in some other species. Although they are classified as independent
	morphological types, it seems likely that their physiological functions
	represent variations on a single organizational plan. These cells
	are present at every level of the inner plexiform layer, which suggests
	that they affect most of the mouse retina's final outputs to the
	brain and, by implication, almost all visual function.},

@article{Maisak:2013ly,
	Abstract = {The extraction of directional motion information from changing retinal
	images is one of the earliest and most important processing steps
	in any visual system. In the fly optic lobe, two parallel processing
	streams have been anatomically described, leading from two first-order
	interneurons, L1 and L2, via T4 and T5 cells onto large, wide-field
	motion-sensitive interneurons of the lobula plate. Therefore, T4
	and T5 cells are thought to have a pivotal role in motion processing;
	however, owing to their small size, it is difficult to obtain electrical
	recordings of T4 and T5 cells, leaving their visual response properties
	largely unknown. We circumvent this problem by means of optical recording
	from these cells in Drosophila, using the genetically encoded calcium
	indicator GCaMP5 (ref. 2). Here we find that specific subpopulations
	of T4 and T5 cells are directionally tuned to one of the four cardinal
	directions; that is, front-to-back, back-to-front, upwards and downwards.
	Depending on their preferred direction, T4 and T5 cells terminate
	in specific sublayers of the lobula plate. T4 and T5 functionally
	segregate with respect to contrast polarity: whereas T4 cells selectively
	respond to moving brightness increments (ON edges), T5 cells only
	respond to moving brightness decrements (OFF edges). When the output
	from T4 or T5 cells is blocked, the responses of postsynaptic lobula
	plate neurons to moving ON (T4 block) or OFF edges (T5 block) are
	selectively compromised. The same effects are seen in turning responses
	of tethered walking flies. Thus, starting with L1 and L2, the visual
	input is split into separate ON and OFF pathways, and motion along
	all four cardinal directions is computed separately within each pathway.
	The output of these eight different motion detectors is then sorted
	such that ON (T4) and OFF (T5) motion detectors with the same directional
	tuning converge in the same layer of the lobula plate, jointly providing
	the input to downstream circuits and motion-driven behaviours.},

@article{Manookin:2008rr,
	Abstract = {Cone signals divide into parallel ON and OFF bipolar cell pathways, which respond to objects brighter or darker than the background and release glutamate onto the corresponding type of ganglion cell. It is assumed that ganglion cell excitatory responses are driven by these bipolar cell synapses. Here, we report an additional mechanism: OFF ganglion cells were driven in part by the removal of synaptic inhibition (disinhibition). The disinhibition played a relatively large role in driving responses at low contrasts. The disinhibition persisted in the presence of CNQX and d-AP-5. Furthermore, the CNQX/d-AP-5-resistant response was blocked by l-AP-4, meclofenamic acid, quinine, or strychnine but not by bicuculline. Thus, the disinhibition circuit was driven by the ON pathway and required gap junctions and glycine receptors but not ionotropic glutamate or GABA(A) receptors. These properties implicate the AII amacrine cell, better known for its role in rod vision, as a critical circuit element through the following pathway: cone --> ON cone bipolar cell --> AII cell --> OFF ganglion cell. Rods could also drive this circuit through their gap junctions with cones. Thus, to light decrement, AII cells, driven by electrical synapses with ON cone bipolar cells, would hyperpolarize and reduce glycine release to excite OFF ganglion cells. To light increment, the AII circuit would directly inhibit OFF ganglion cells. These results show a new role for disinhibition in the retina and suggest a new role for the AII amacrine cell in daylight vision.},

	Abstract = {Starburst amacrine cells in the mammalian retina respond asymmetrically to movement along their dendrites; centrifugal movement elicits stronger responses in each dendrite than centripetal movement. It has been suggested that the asymmetrical response can be attributed to intrinsic properties of the processes themselves. But starburst cells are known to release and have receptors for both GABA and acetylcholine. We tested whether interactions within the starburst cell network can contribute to their directional response properties. In a computational model of interacting starburst amacrine cells, we simulated the response of individual dendrites to moving light stimuli. By setting the model parameters for "synaptic connection strength" (cs) to positive or negative values, overlapping starburst dendrites could either excite or inhibit each other. For some values of cs, we observed a very robust inward/outward asymmetry of the starburst dendrites consistent with the reported physiological findings. This is the case, for example, if a starburst cell receives inhibition from other starburst cells located in its surround. For other values of cs, individual dendrites can respond best either to inward movement or respond symmetrically. A properly wired network of starburst cells can therefore account for the experimentally observed asymmetry of their response to movement, independent of any internal biophysical or biochemical properties of starburst cell dendrites.},

	Abstract = {The biophysical mechanisms that give rise to direction selectivity in the retina remain uncertain. Current evidence suggests that the directional signal first arises within the dendrites of starburst amacrine cells (SBACs). Two models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, one based on mutual inhibitory interactions between SBACs, and the other positing an intrinsic dendritic mechanism requiring a voltage-gradient depolarizing towards the dendritic tips. We tested these models by recording current and voltage responses to visual stimuli in SBACs. In agreement with previous work, we found that the excitatory currents in the SBACs were directional, and remained directional when GABA receptors were blocked. Contrary to the mutual-inhibitory model, stimuli that produce strong directional signals in ganglion cells failed to reveal a significant inhibitory input to SBACs. Suppression of the tonic excitatory conductance, proposed to generate the dendritic voltage-gradient required for the dendrite autonomous model, failed to eliminate the directional signal in SBACs. However, selective block of tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels did reduce the strength of the directional excitatory signal in the SBACs. These results indicate that current models of direction-selectivity in the SBACs are inadequate, and suggest that voltage-gated excitatory channels, specifically tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels, are important elements in directional signaling. This is the first physiological evidence that tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels play a role in retinal information processing.},

	Abstract = {Rabbit retinas were isolated from the eye and maintained in vitro.
	When they were incubated for 60 min in the presence of 3H-GABA, subsequent
	autoradiography showed radioactivity to be present primarily in amacrine
	cells. Under these conditions, most of the radioactivity contained
	in the retinas remained in the chemical form of GABA. Autoradiography
	and immunohistochemistry of alternate sections showed the amacrine
	cells that accumulate 3H-GABA to be the same cells that contain endogenous
	GABA immunoreactivity. These include the starburst cells, the indoleamine-accumulating
	cells, and other, as yet unidentified amacrine cells. The localization
	confirms previous immunohistochemical findings. When retinas containing
	3H-GABA were expressed to elevated concentrations of K+, their content
	of 3H-GABA decreased. Autoradiography showed a reduced 3H-GABA content
	in all of the cells that contained 3H-GABA. Since those include the
	starburst cells, previously shown to be cholinergic, the finding
	demonstrates that the starburst cells release both ACh and GABA.
	Retinas simultaneously labeled with 14C-GABA and 3H-ACh were superfused,
	and the release of radioactive compounds from the retina was studied.
	Depolarization by elevated K+ caused an increased recovery of both
	ACh and GABA in the superfusate, but the predominant mechanisms of
	their release appeared to be different. The stimulated release of
	ACh was entirely Ca2+ dependent, while the release of radioactivity
	originating from GABA was much less so. A concentration-dependent
	counterflux (homoexchange) of intracellular GABA was demonstrated
	by raising the extracellular concentration of GABA (or nipecotic
	acid). These results suggest that a large outward flux of GABA occurs
	via the GABA transporter, probably by the potential-sensitive mechanism
	studied by Schwartz (1982, 1987). Stimulation of double-labeled retinas
	by flashing light or moving bars always increased the release of
	ACh, and the release was entirely dependent on the presence of extracellular
	Ca2+. Stimulation with light never caused a detectable release of
	GABA. This was unexpected, since the two neurotransmitters are present
	in the same amacrine cells: stimulation adequate to release one neurotransmitter
	should release both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {Bipolar cells are the central neurons of the retina that convey visual
	signals from rod and cone photoreceptors in the outer retina to higher-order
	neurons in the inner retina and the brain. Early anatomical studies
	have suggested that there are four types of cone hyperpolarizing
	(OFF) bipolar cells (HBCs) in the mouse retina, but no light responses
	have been systematically examined. By analysing light-evoked cation
	and chloride currents (I(C) and I(Cl)) from over 50 morphologically
	identified HBCs in the dark-adapted wildtype and connexin36 knockout
	(Cx36(-/-)) mouse retinas, we identified three types of HBCs, each
	with distinct light responses and morphological characteristics.
	The HBC(R/MC)s with axon terminals ramifying between 0% and 30% of
	the inner plexiform layer (IPL) receive mixed inputs from rods and
	M-cones, the HBC(MC)s with axon terminals ramifying between 10% and
	50% of the IPL receive inputs primarily from M-cones, and the HBC(M/SC)s
	with axon terminals ramifying between 25% and 50% of IPL receive
	inputs primarily from cones with mixed M- and S-cone pigments. Moreover,
	we found that HBC(R/MC)s in the Cx36(-/-) mice exhibit light responses
	very similar to the wildtype HBC(R/MC)s, suggesting that the mixed
	rod-cone inputs are not mediated by connexin36-dependent rod-cone

	This study constitutes the first systematic investigation that correlates

	Abstract = {Direction selectivity represents a fundamental visual computation. In mammalian retina, On-Off direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) respond strongly to motion in a preferred direction and weakly to motion in the opposite, null direction. Electrical recordings suggested three direction-selective (DS) synaptic mechanisms: DS GABA release during null-direction motion from starburst amacrine cells (SACs) and DS acetylcholine and glutamate release during preferred direction motion from SACs and bipolar cells. However, evidence for DS acetylcholine and glutamate release has been inconsistent and at least one bipolar cell type that contacts another DSGC (On-type) lacks DS release. Here, whole-cell recordings in mouse retina showed that cholinergic input to On-Off DSGCs lacked DS, whereas the remaining (glutamatergic) input showed apparent DS. Fluorescence measurements with the glutamate biosensor intensity-based glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporter (iGluSnFR) conditionally expressed in On-Off DSGCs showed that glutamate release in both On- and Off-layer dendrites lacked DS, whereas simultaneously recorded excitatory currents showed apparent DS. With GABA-A receptors blocked, both iGluSnFR signals and excitatory currents lacked DS. Our measurements rule out DS release from bipolar cells onto On-Off DSGCs and support a theoretical model suggesting that apparent DS excitation in voltage-clamp recordings results from inadequate voltage control of DSGC dendrites during null-direction inhibition. SAC GABA release is the apparent sole source of DS input onto On-Off DSGCs.},

	Abstract = {In the retina, photoreceptors pass visual information to interneurons, which process it and pass it to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Axons of RGCs then travel through the optic nerve, telling the rest of the brain all it will ever know about the visual world. Research over the past several decades has made clear that most RGCs are not merely light detectors, but rather feature detectors, which send a diverse set of parallel, highly processed images of the world on to higher centers. Here, we review progress in classification of RGCs by physiological, morphological, and molecular criteria, making a particular effort to distinguish those cell types that are definitive from those for which information is partial. We focus on the mouse, in which molecular and genetic methods are most advanced. We argue that there are around 30 RGC types and that we can now account for well over half of all RGCs. We also use RGCs to examine the general problem of neuronal classification, arguing that insights and methods from the retina can guide the classification enterprise in other brain regions.

	Abstract = {The On-Off direction-selective ganglion cell (DSGC) in mammalian retinas
	responds most strongly to a stimulus moving in a specific direction.
	The DSGC initiates spikes in its dendritic tree, which are thought
	to propagate to the soma with high probability. Both dendritic and
	somatic spikes in the DSGC display strong directional tuning, whereas
	somatic PSPs (postsynaptic potentials) are only weakly directional,
	indicating that spike generation includes marked enhancement of the
	directional signal. We used a realistic computational model based
	on anatomical and physiological measurements to determine the source
	of the enhancement. Our results indicate that the DSGC dendritic
	tree is partitioned into separate electrotonic regions, each summing
	its local excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to initiate spikes.
	Within each local region the local spike threshold nonlinearly amplifies
	the preferred response over the null response on the basis of PSP
	amplitude. Using inhibitory conductances previously measured in DSGCs,
	the simulation results showed that inhibition is only sufficient
	to prevent spike initiation and cannot affect spike propagation.
	Therefore, inhibition will only act locally within the dendritic
	arbor. We identified the role of three mechanisms that generate directional
	selectivity (DS) in the local dendritic regions. First, a mechanism
	for DS intrinsic to the dendritic structure of the DSGC enhances
	DS on the null side of the cell's dendritic tree and weakens it on
	the preferred side. Second, spatially offset postsynaptic inhibition
	generates robust DS in the isolated dendritic tips but weak DS near
	the soma. Third, presynaptic DS is apparently necessary because it
	is more robust across the dendritic tree. The pre- and postsynaptic
	mechanisms together can overcome the local intrinsic DS. These local
	dendritic mechanisms can perform independent nonlinear computations
	to make a decision, and there could be analogous mechanisms within
	cortical circuitry.},

The second is completeness-developing methods guaranteed to eventually identify all cell types, as well as criteria for determining when all types have been found. Case studies illustrate how these two challenges are handled by combining state-of-the-art molecular, anatomical, and physiological techniques.

We quantified the stratification patterns to predict potential synaptic connectivity between marked cells of different lines and found that some of the lines enabled targeted recordings and imaging of cell types from developing or mature retinal circuits.

@article{Sivyer:2010zp,
	Abstract = {There are two types of direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) identified in the rabbit retina, which can be readily distinguished both morphologically and physiologically. The well characterized ON-OFF DSGCs respond to a broad range of image velocities whereas the less common ON DSGCs are tuned to slower image velocities. This study examined how the synaptic inputs shape the velocity tuning of DSGCs in an isolated preparation of the rabbit retina. The receptive-field properties were mapped by extracellular spike recordings and compared with the light-evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances that were measured under voltage-clamp. The synaptic mechanisms underlying the generation of direction selectivity appear to be similar in both cell types in that preferred-direction image motion elicits a greater excitatory input and null-direction image motion elicits a greater inhibitory input. To examine the temporal tuning of the DSGCs, the cells were stimulated with either a grating drifted over the receptive-field centre at a range of velocities or with a light spot flickered at different temporal frequencies. Whereas the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the ON-OFF DSGCs are relatively constant over a wide range of temporal frequencies, the ON DSGCs receive less excitation and more inhibition at higher temporal frequencies. Moreover, transient inhibition precedes sustained excitation in the ON DSGCs, leading to slowly activating, sustained spike responses. Consequently, at higher temporal frequencies, weaker excitation combines with fast-rising inhibition resulting in lower spike output.},

Here we exploit recent progress in genetic definition of cell types in an objective structural approach to neuronal classification. The approach is based on highly accurate quantification of dendritic arbor position relative to neurites of other cells. We test the method on a population of 363 mouse retinal ganglion cells. For each cell, we determine the spatial distribution of the dendritic arbors, or arbor density, with reference to arbors of an abundant, well-defined interneuronal type. The arbor densities are sorted into a number of clusters that is set by comparison with several molecularly defined cell types. The algorithm reproduces the genetic classes that are pure types, and detects six newly clustered cell types that await genetic definition.},

	min with 4% paraformaldehyde, and mounted flat on the stage of a

	accomplished, at retinal locations systematically covering the retinal
	surface. The cells stained with DAPI were found to form a single
	morphological population. They have two to seven primary dendrites,
	which branch repeatedly within a narrow plane and form a round or
	slightly oval dendritic tree. The branching becomes very fine for
	the distal one third of the dendritic tree, and the dendrites there
	are studded with small swellings. The distal dendritic tree lies
	mainly within one of the two thin strata of the inner plexiform layer

	tree are continuously graded across the retina, the dendritic tree
	is narrower and the branching denser in the central retina, wider

	and the shape of the neurons, one can reconstruct the array of dendrites
	that exists within the inner plexiform layer. The overlap of the

Three synaptic asymmetries were identified that contribute to the generation of direction-selective responses: (1) a presynaptic mechanism producing stronger excitation in the preferred direction, (2) a presynaptic mechanism producing stronger inhibition in the opposite direction, and (3) postsynaptic interaction of excitation with spatially offset inhibition. Although the on- and off-responses showed the same directional tuning, the off-response was generated by all three mechanisms, whereas the on-response was generated primarily by the two presynaptic mechanisms. The results indicate that, within a single neuron, different strategies are used within distinct dendritic arbors to accomplish the same neural computation.},

	Abstract = {The On-Off direction-selective (DS) ganglion cells in the rabbit retina comprise four discrete subtypes that orthogonally code the direction of image motion. This study examined the dendritic relationships between different subtypes of On-Off DS cells, which were identified by their distinctive type 1 bistratified (BiS1) morphology following the intracellular injection of a biotinylated tracer or Lucifer yellow under direct microscopic control. The dendrites of BiS1 cells that had closely spaced somata, which presumably comprised subtypes of On-Off DS cells with different preferred directions, were not randomly superimposed but were fasciculated into loose bundles. By contrast, tracer coupling revealed that neighboring On-Off DS cells of one subtype were highly territorial, providing complete coverage of the retina with minimal overlap. This mirrors, on a larger scale, the territorial organization within the dendritic tree of individual DS cells, suggesting that similar interactions shape both the branching pattern and the spatial extent of these neurons. Moreover, the dendrites at the edge of the dendritic field often formed tip-to-shaft or tip-to-tip contacts with dendrites from coupled cells, thus appearing to form closed dendritic loops that may be equivalent to those found within the dendritic tree. Consequently, the dendrites of one subtype are distributed uniformly and economically across the retina. The resulting plexus forms a strikingly regular scaffold on which the presynaptic interneurons generate direction selectivity.},

	Abstract = {Direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) are tuned to motion in one direction. Starburst amacrine cells (SACs) are thought to mediate this direction selectivity through precise anatomical wiring to DSGCs. Nevertheless, we previously found that visual adaptation can reverse DSGCs's directional tuning, overcoming the circuit anatomy. Here we explore the role of SACs in the generation and adaptation of direction selectivity. First, using pharmacogenetics and two-photon calcium imaging, we validate that SACs are necessary for direction selectivity. Next, we demonstrate that exposure to an adaptive stimulus dramatically alters SACs' synaptic inputs. Specifically, after visual adaptation, On-SACs lose their excitatory input during light onset but gain an excitatory input during light offset. Our data suggest that visual stimulation alters the interactions between rod- and cone-mediated inputs that converge on the terminals of On-cone BCs. These results demonstrate how the sensory environment can modify computations performed by anatomically defined neuronal circuits.},

	Abstract = {We identified the ON-OFF direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) in the mouse retina and characterized their physiological, morphological and pharmacological properties. These cells showed transient responses to the onset and termination of a stationary flashing spot, and strong directional selectivity to a moving rectangle. Application of various pharmacological reagents demonstrated that the ON-OFF DSGCs in the mouse retina utilize a similar array of transmitters and receptors to compute motion direction to their counterparts in the rabbit retina. Voltage clamp recording showed that ON-OFF DSGCs in the mouse retina receive a larger inhibitory input when the stimulus is moving in the null direction and a larger excitatory input when the stimulus is moving in the preferred direction. Finally, intracellular infusion of neurobiotin revealed a bistratified dendritic field with recursive dendrites forming loop-like structures, previously classified as RG(D2) by morphology. Overall, the ON-OFF DSGCs in the mouse retina exhibit almost identical properties to their counterparts in the rabbit retina, indicating that the mechanisms for computing motion direction are conserved from mouse to rabbit, and probably also to higher mammals. This first detailed characterization of ON-OFF DSGCs in the mouse retina provides fundamental information for further study of maturation and regulation of the neuronal circuitry underlying computation of direction.},

	Caenorhabditis elegans has been deduced from reconstructions of electron
	micrographs of serial sections. The hermaphrodite nervous system
	has a total complement of 302 neurons, which are arranged in an essentially

	have been grouped together into classes; there are 118 such classes.
	Neurons have simple morphologies with few, if any, branches. Processes
	from neurons run in defined positions within bundles of parallel

	are arranged longitudinally and circumferentially and are often adjacent
	to ridges of hypodermis. Neurons are generally highly locally connected,

	cells have arms that run out to process bundles containing motoneuron
	axons. Here they receive their synaptic input in defined regions
	along the surface of the bundles, where motoneuron axons reside.
	Most of the morphologically identifiable synaptic connections in

	In the retina, the direction of image motion is computed in four

	first appears. We recorded the concerted activity of the neuronal
	circuit elements of single direction-selective (DS) retinal ganglion
	cells at subcellular resolution by combining GCaMP3-functionalized
	transsynaptic viral tracing and two-photon imaging. While the visually
	evoked activity of the dendritic segments of the DS cells were direction
	selective, direction-selective activity was absent in the axon terminals
	of bipolar cells. Furthermore, the glutamate input to DS cells, recorded
	using a genetically encoded glutamate sensor, also lacked direction
	selectivity. Therefore, the first stage in which extraction of a
	cardinal motion direction occurs is the dendrites of DS cells.},

The cellular origin and mechanism of directional selectivity were investigated by selectively eliminating retinal starburst amacrine cells, using immunotoxin-mediated cell targeting techniques. Starburst cell ablation in the adult retina abolished not only directional selectivity of ganglion cell responses but also an optokinetic eye reflex derived by stimulus movement. Starburst cells therefore serve as the key element that discriminates the direction of stimulus movement through integrative synaptic transmission and play a pivotal role in information processing that stabilizes image motion.},

	Abstract = {Detection of the direction of image movement is accomplished first
	in the retina by an elegant neuronal circuit, which integrates multiple
	levels of spatially asymmetric synaptic interactions among subsets
	of bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cells. Central to these interactions
	is the asymmetric GABAergic inhibition exerted by the starburst amacrine
	cell (SAC), a cholinergic and GABAergic interneuron with a radially
	symmetric dendritic tree. SACs make reciprocal GABAergic synapses
	on each other to create a direct inhibitory receptive field surround,
	which suppresses the response of each SAC to centripetal image movement.
	Each radially projecting branch of a SAC responds to image movement
	with a centrifugal bias and, through directionally asymmetric synaptic
	connections with the dendrites of direction-selective ganglion cells
	(DSGCs), exerts a spatially offset inhibition that vetoes the response
	of DSGCs to image movement in a specific (null) direction. Recent
	physiological studies have greatly advanced our understanding of
